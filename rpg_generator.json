      "(Puzzle 1 with the following rule) Play it as a 'follow the leader'. Stone flashes white and resets if fail. Target is for a player to do something to a stone, then next player repeats and adds something, then next... (ex. Player 1 pats the stone, Player 2 pats the stone then stands on it, Player 3 pats it, stands on it, and puts a ration on it, etc.) Once each player has added 2 'moves' and the last one plays the whole chosen sequence, it opens. This can be done via irl rp.",

      "This puzzle is known as Towers of Hanoi. While not difficult per-se, a sufficiently large set is time consuming. Three enigmatic pillars about 1 foot tall sit atop a small ledge, with a series of (d4 + 2) disks stacked on the one furthest to the left. The disks decrease in size as you reach the top of the stack. You must move the disks to the furthest pillar by moving a single disk to any pillar. You may not place a larger disk above a smaller disk.",

The next room is identical, but the door ahead is unlocked, and the button drops the party down a pit.",

      "Button next to door says \"open/close\". When pressed it appears to do nothing, but that's because there is a minor illusion that makes the door always appear closed. Unseen, the door did open or close after pressing the button each time. Attempts to touch the illusion will break it, or a perception check to see through it. If pressed repeatedly, perceptive characters will start hearing a scraping noise of opening and closing, as a hint that it's working unseen.",

You can give strength checks to throw them off and make it seem like they are too weak. Solution: the door doesn't swing in or out, it raises up and down from the floor. Investigation to find out. Simple strength to actually push it down.",

The small key unlocks half the door; the big thick door splits apart to reveal it is two doors with a mirror sandwiched between the layers. The magic mirror can be stepped through and leads to a secret location. Smashing the door breaks the mirror and makes it unusable.

The nameplates reset themselves automatically, and the distribution of incorrect plates is random.",
      "There is a door, with a big indent, shaped like the artifact your group has picked up not long ago. So you clearly need to put the artifact in the door. The only issue is, the indent is shaped like the mirror copy of the item you're holding. Did I mention there's a mirror in the room?

      "A room that's not fully visible from the entrance (L-shaped, T-shaped, whatever) and if you enter the room you can clearly hear the sound of a shutting door (GM's choice if there is another non-hidden door in the room). The Trick: the whole floor is a clever crafted pressure plate which shuts the secret door so you have either to fly, do some acrobatic rope play or climb over the furnishing in a kind of \"the floor is lava\" as the furniture stands on \"safe spots\". Once closed the secret doors only opens again after nothing stands on the plate and all non-hidden doors are closed from outside.",

On the other side is the exact copy of the room and a shapeshifting guardian who mimics the group(maybe best would be some kind of liquid golem so he can even mimic a whole group or put more guardians in the room). this may be noticed by small mistakes of the copies or their movement. After the group gets in the second room you also have a good mid-bossfight. Optional: If you have a aggressive group you can hide acid traps behind the wrong mirrors to prevent that they just smash their way through this puzzle.",

      "A hatch is hidden at the bottom of a pool of water in a dim room and can be found by touch. The weight of the water keeps the hatch door from opening upwards. The water must be drained, perhaps by unclogging hidden drains. The drained water may also be relevent to a later puzzle.",

      "An ancient stone portal bears a number of glowing symbols on the face. The symbols are incomplete math equations, which need to be completed to open the door. The now-lost species that made the door treasured mathematical skill, seeing it as a literal gift from the gods; being correct in your math was seen as being correct in all things. The more important/dangerous the door, the more difficult the equation is to finish (since clearly a person who can do math that advanced can be trusted with the contents), on top of the difficulty of interpreting numeric and mathematical symbols not written by a living hand in 7 centuries.",

      "Room visually only has one entrance/exit, no doors. Walls are marked with a script (whatever language you want) that just says \"WALL\", the floor says \"FLOOR\", the ceiling says \"CEILING\". Drawing a door on a wall does nothing; drawing a door on a wall and writing \"DOOR\" automatically opens the drawn door to a safe room (or treasure room, or \"next\" room, whatever room you wanted it to be).",
      "A large balance scale rests in the middle of the room. Between two large golden pans, there is a traditionally-garbed wizard statue connected to the scale's bar at it's center. One side of the scale touches the floor with only a feather weighing down the large golden pan. Nonmagical items have no weight on the scale and only magical items can cause the scale to rise/fall. In some foreign language, the words \"Enchanter's Judgement\" is carved into the statue. The feather is a magical item (casts featherfall maybe?). Balancing the scale (take off the feather, put a magical item of equal value) opens one passage; outweighing the scale opens up the same passage as well as another (an alcove or treasure trove).",
      "The obvious doorway is a red herring, and is nailed shut. The mortar on the adjacent wall dissolves upon contact with water, and removing the bricks reveals the true passage.",
      "A large tomb with two dials with symbols that need to be aligned correctly. Selecting the symbols for \"After\" and \"Life\" opens the tomb and a false bottom leads to a staircase.",
      "A plain wall has a sign that reads: \"shake hands, and be welcome\". Nearby there is a statue ... but it's old, and has lost both arms. Except it hasn't. It's an illusion hiding the non-broken statue. Shake hands with it, and an open door is revealed in the wall.",
      "There is a door, alright, but it has no handle an no magic seems to work on it. It's right there, on that wall. On both sides of the door there's a lot of lit torches. Man, they're bright! This is the Door of Shadows. It will only open when shadows are cast upon it. What's behind such a door? Only one way to find out",
      "A fountain in the shape of an agony struck face of an old, scary man. The fountain water makes it look as if the male face is crying. If you tell the fountain a joke (successful perform-action) the water stops and the face is re-assembled with the mouth opening wide, the beard hair shifting where the eyebrows were and vice-versa so that it now looks like a person whose agony stems from barely being able to breathe laughing.

      "A pit trap opens up beneath a character. At the bottom of the bit they are falling into is a button that drops a stone block on top of them, covering the hole and smashing the character.",
      "A lever with a sign that says \"Pull to open\" next to a locked door with an extremely poorly hid trap door right under the entrance. Pulling the lever surprisingly opens the door. If you touch the door without pulling the lever, the trap door opens.",
      "A series of regal-looking interconnected hallways are dimly lit with magical torches suspended in sconces. The entrance that the intruders come through suddenly closes itself off, and the intruders sit in silence for a few seconds. Looking down one of the other hallways reveals a slowly encroaching patch of darkness that snuffs out the torches as it makes its way forward, which relight themselves when intruders approach them while the darkness is not nearby. The intruders must search the various corridors while simultaneously avoiding the patch of darkness, which envelops and leaves no trace of anything that enters it. Any attempts to do combat with the darkness prove ineffectual, as anything that enters vanishes, never to be seen again. The darkness is semi-sentient, and the intruders can interact with it by trying to hide from it or get it to follow them. The key to escaping the hallways lies with the magic torches in the two impressively decorated sconces that the darkness can't seem to pass by. By removing one of the special torches and carrying it with them, an intruder can hold off the darkness or even push it back. However, confronting it for too long will begin to dim the torch until it eventually snuffs out, forcing the holder to escape the darkness in order for the torch to relight. When the special torches approach the darkness from both sides of a hallway, it condenses and eventually fades, leaving a shadowy door to the outside where the last of it vanished.",
      "A roughly cut gemstone hovers ominously over a crude alter in a cavernlike room while a malicious spirit floats up around the ceiling and out of sight. New entities entering the room causes the crystal turn to face the intruders, revealing that it is actually an eye of some sort, containing a pupil that darts rapidly between the intruders and the spirit. The spirit immediately begins cajoling the crystal eye into destroying the intruders, talking to it as though it were a child in need of guidance. After a few seconds of apparent listening, the eye completely focuses on the spirit and pillars of rock begin to rapidly erupt from the room's surfaces at points near the intruders. The pillars, while initially inaccurate, begin homing in on the intruders more and more the longer they stay still, and do 5d10 bludgeoning damage on a hit. The key to escaping the room is the crystal eye in the center of the room, which is being told by the spirit to kill the intruders. By being more persuasive than the spirit, intruders can convince the eye to stop its onslaught and eventually target the spirit instead, which will disperse after being hit multiple times with pillars of rock. The eye is very childlike in its considerations and will lose focus if the intruders fail to convince it or begin to act too impatient. Simplistic approaches work well, and the eye responds positively to constructive encouragement when it targets the intruders (That was some very good aiming, I could feel the wind rush by me! Next time though, try to aim towards the mean spirit instead, OK?). Once the spirit is destroyed, a gentle suggestion that the eye create an exit will convince it to pull a slab of rock away from a wall and reveal a passage to outside the room.",
      "Walking through an area with \"Dormant hives of bees,\" there is a queen bee figurine with a stinger shaped like a key in a glass jar at the opening of a room. The jar acts as a seal to keep the pheromones of the queen away from the rest of her hive. Once removed from the jar to unlock a mysterious key hole, the once dormant hives awaken to attack whomsoever holds \"their queen.\"",
      "A nearly invisible gelatinous cube encloses an entire section of a hallway/corridor. Requires strong perception check to even see. Will immediately begin digesting any adventurers who walk into it, tinging the clear jelly a slight pink color.",
      "A hallway with what appear to be dart traps, or falling spike traps, or fire. There are several different hallways in a succession of 3 (so imagine three hallways one after the other with different traps, with a small room between each that could hold 4-6 people. Each hallway starts with 2 statues. The first hallway deactivates the traps by grasping one of the hands and turning it down. Once the next hallway both statues have hands that turn, and one activates the traps just cleared while the other deactivates the ones ahead (but both can't happen so if the try to deactivate the traps ahead it will still be active). And finally the last hallway will deactivate the traps but the floor is pressure sensitive. Illustrate this by having the party see the hand start to turn back when a member starts to walk across. Essentially the first two hallways punish groups that don't follow right behind the rogue and send him forward to handle traps, while the last hallway punishes players who just follow right behind the rogue, and are afraid to make any distance.",
      "A map is found on a skeleton wrapped around an old skeleton key. The map shows traps, but all the information is either half right or all wrong.

If any character steps entirely inside and the door is not blocked, the door will shut and meld into the stone of the wall.

The character inside the chamber will begin to suffocate after one hour and takes one level of exhaustion after each additional hour.",
      "Walking down a hallway, the party passes through a large set of wooden reinforced doors. Beyond these doors is another hallway about 50ft long. In this hallway, there are 10 large sets of full steel armor with varying weapons from daggers, long swords, flails, whips, mauls, glaives etc (all of which are very well made). They're lined up along the walls of the hallway 5 on each side. If any of the armor or weapons are touched. Every single set of armor will come alive equipping the weapons they had, attacking the closest target immediately. The doors will also be slammed shut, slamming into anything in it?s way. The doors will only unlock if the sets of armor have been killed.",
      "You enter a dungeon with an open pit in the middle of the floor, runes that you can?t decipher are around the hole. As you approach you can hear the cries of a small child, and when you look into the pit you can see a human child covered in dirty rags. You?re able to get the child out, but they say they can?t cross the runes and you?ll have to lift them up and over them. When you do, the child (vampire) tries to feed from you, dealing piercing damage.",

If you open the first door a swarm of cranium rats will descend upon you, alerting you to a mindflayers? presence. If you open the second door three Spawn of Kyuss embrace you. If you open the third door, two Shadow Mastiffs lunge at you.",
      "A trap that is very kobold related, but could work for other creatures is this? Walking along a cliff either in a mountain/volcano or on it, a party member hits a pressure pad beneath some rubble, or dirt (depends on the environment). A harpoon shoots out and gets the member in the leg. A kobold who was waiting kicks a weight attached to a chain out and it drags the member down the side of the cliff to about 20ft above the next level (assuming they don?t pass a strength check at disadvantage). The ambush comes and there are kobolds on the lower level trying to reach the member while the party is ambushed and distracted. They will have to decide who is saving their friend and who is fighting, while the member is dangling and until he gets himself right side up is at a disadvantage to all attacks. The weight unless removed from the chain is going to disadvantage his climb (and the pain from a hook in his leg will make the climb a bit more difficult too). For ideas on how the chain looks, think of a fishing hook with a weight on it.",

      "A door that opens into a short hall, behind the door is a poorly hidden log tied to the ceiling, but opening the door didn?t cause it to swing, must be a dud. Touching the door on the other side causes the stone slab that was the floor to slide into the wall, causing the player to fall into a pit of brambles, and the false log trap detaches and falls on top of them. Can be solved by throwing a rock at the door on the other side, the log will fall and create a safe bridge across the brambles.",

      "In a narrow hallway, you have a part of the floor that folds down when to much weight is put on and springs back to its normal position once the weight has been dropped.

The walls of the well have small holes all along its length, possibly from climbing pitons. Once a certain amount of weight is applied to the rope (equivalent to two or three party members) a gelatinous cube is poured from its cell behind the stones in the wall, and seeps through the walls into the well above the players. The gelatinous cube paralyzes creatures when they touch it and fail a save. The cube happily slides down the well and consumes its prey until all organic material is digested, then it seeps through the grate at the bottom and it collected and replaced in its cell behind the stonework.",
      "A treasure chest in a 10' square pit. The entire pit is clean and smooth stone, making it difficult to climb. If weight is added to the floor of the pit (set to the weight of one or more humanoid adventurers) the pit and 1 foot of the pit walls is shot upward to the ceiling cutting off all means of escape. The walls then close in and collapse all humanoids unless they pile on top of the chest, which is not crushed. The treasure chest is a mimic but is magically paralyzed until the walls fully collapse inward, at which point he mimic is released from its spell and the trap resets in 1d4 days.",
      "A shield guardian with a stored spell of invisibility blocks a hallway or doorway and goes invisible before adventurers can see it. The Guardian body blocks the path and ambushes the first adventurer to bump into it.",
      "A pitfall into a pond of ooze. As the adventures move around the pond seems to start moving of it?s own accord and slowly drags anything on it?s surface into it?s depths.",
      "A pitfall into with a pool of flammable oil. The victims can climb out of the pool into a long corridor leading back to where they where. Along the way are magical swinging candles, mini flamethrowers, and minor fire elementals.",
      "A seemingly normal abandoned bathroom. There is a tripwire coming out of one of the stalls, that tightly seals the only door. Then, contaminated water starts coming out of the toilets. The adventurers must break the door to escape, and if they touch the water, they get sick.",
      "A bedroom with enough beds for the party to sleep on. There are pressure plates under the mattresses, that open small holes in the walls. Slowly but surely, a neurotoxin starts coming out of the holes, and seamlessly fills the room, while the adventurers sleep.",
      "A rickety wooden bridge over a big dark pit, with snakes on the bottom. There is a hole on one of the side walls (requiring a passive perception check to notice). The bridge itself is relatively safe, but there is a thin tripwire halfway through it, that activates the hole, making it spill out a line of fire over the end of the bridge.",
      "A wall with three stone doors. There is a paper on it, saying that two of the doors lead to a treasure, while another kills whoever is passing through. Going through those doors is not necessary for the adventure. If a player decides to try their luck, roll a d6 to see what happens.",
      "A treasure room, filled with open and empty chests. There is only one closed container. If the adventurers loot it, the trap is deactivated. If they try to leave without touching it, a loud sound is heard, waking up all of the mimics.",
      "The adventurers must go through a door. There is a paper on it, with the words: \"Be polite\", and a happy face. The door leads to an abandoned workshop, filled with statues and gargoyles. They have to shake the hands of every gargoyle before leaving the room, otherwise they will attack the party.",
      "This is a standard pit-trap with a twist. At the bottom of the pit, and for ten feet up the walls, everything is coated in pitch. Pitch may be sticky, but in quantity it also acts like any other oil-based liquid ? a lubricant. Climbing up a rope becomes extremely unlikely for whoever fell down the hole. But that?s not the worst bit. A couple of rounds after the pit trap is activated, the Kobolds, warned by a bell attached to the pit trap?s trigger, will show up with lit torches. And one of them will start combat by throwing a torch into the pit ? igniting the pitch!",
      "Oil floats on water: You all know the scene. In the middle of the vast dungeon is a lake. At one edge of the lake is a boat. The heroes have to pile into the boat and row across the lake to the next section of the dungeon. Well, this particular lake is guarded by kobolds with spyglasses. And a few barrels full of lamp oil. And a torch. Be sure to wait until the party is most of the way across the lake before the kobolds start pouring lamp oil on the water.",
      "Kobolds are light, and armor is heavy: A well prepared Kobold always has an escape route. And his escape route is generally one only a Kobold can use. While most Kobolds choose to make tight passages that only a Tiny creature can squeeze into (thanks to their ability to fit into unlikely places), some rely on the fact that their pursuers are generally heavier, and in larger numbers, than themselves. Choose a corridor, and undermine it (dig a tunnel under the floor, but with too little material acting as floor/ceiling). Leave it just enough strength to handle the weight of a Kobold or two. Fill the corridor below with something nasty, and have it lead somewhere nasty. As a finishing touch, make sure there?s a collapsing ceiling in the upper tunnel as well to ensure that the heroes can?t climb back out after you.",
      "Gold melts at a surprisingly low temperature: Did you know that you can melt gold in a candle flame? It would probably take about an hour to do so from room temperature, but you can. More importantly, if you keep your gold coins at a hot enough temperature, they?ll melt very quickly if exposed to a very potent heat source ? like say they might melt within seconds if they were doused in lamp oil and lit. This is an interesting thing to note if your chosen method of storing gold coins is in a wire-mesh cage attached to the ceiling. Especially if such a cage is kept at very high temperature, and is trapped with various kinds of flame traps (flame traps that trigger onto the gold). Unfortunately, while the temperature might be relatively high compared to the meltin point of most metal, it?s still more than enough to cook any flesh it comes in contact with (and STICK to that flesh, as molten metal tends to, causing the WORST sort of burns). And of course, the easiest way to get at the gold itself is from directly below it. Be sure to note to the party how hot it is in the room with the gold while they?re standing under it. If they?re clever enough to figure out the trap beforehand, hopefully they?re also clever enough to notice the hidden drains in the floor before all that molten gold runs (very, very quickly) down those drains.",
      "At the end of a hallway is a fake door. When the doorknob is turned, a latch is released, and the spring mounted door flies out at whoever opened the door. Since the door takes up most of the hallway, there is no chance to dodge it at all. The person who attempted to open the door takes 2d6 points of damage, and anyone standing within 5 feet of the door will take 1d6 points of damage.",
      "Anyone weighing more than 150 lbs. will cause a lid to a pit to open. The pit is 25 feet deep.",
      "The character steps into the trap and the gem eyes from a roomful of statues shoots rays at him. The PC is zapped and appears to be disintegrated. A skeleton appears in his place. It?s important that the PC?s don?t get a chance to detect this trap or they?ll quickly find a solution (Search DC30). The character is teleported to a sealed tomb filled with the skeletons of various victims. A black pudding, CR equal to the party, attempts to engulf the teleported PC and turn him into a skeleton with its acid. When the trap goes off, one of these skeletons is instantly teleported to where the PC was standing, making it appear like he was disintegrated. Make a Search DC 25 to notice the skeleton (pile of bones) is not the same makeup as the PC (DC 20 if the size category of the PC is one larger or smaller than medium). After six teleportations, the \"living\" victims (or their remains) are teleported back to the trap area. Defeat the trap by moving statues into the area so they can be teleported, eventually sending out \"victims.\"",

      "A long passage of murky, depthless water. Two boats are tied up at the entrance- one that looks rickety and has a little water in the bottom, and one that is new looking, gilded on the edges and looks really watertight. Turns out the \"new\" boat is actually an illusion, and it disappears in a puff of smoke about halfway through.",

      "A seemingly wooden door that says \"Knock\". Knock on the door to enter. ALTERNATIVELY: a seemingly wooden door, badly worn; it seems as if it could just be destroyed. Players can see the other side, in fact. Catch? Nobody but the weakest among any group that approaches it, can open it. It cannot be destroyed by anything.",
      "A badly written sign in [the language of whatever people made the dungeon] that says \"beware\"; the area is somewhat stinky. It leads to a small hallway with another likewise-made/written sign that says \"turn back\". It?s getting smellier now, and much more damp. If the party continues, they find themselves at the bottom of the underground shithouse. Bonus: if they made it this far, and if they get clever and can?t smell anything and want to risk being a social pariah for the next several days, they can climb the spout to the room(s) connected, above.",

On failing a DC 15 Wisdom check, they walk towards the voice which leads to a hag nest. The voice emanates from one of the hags. On a successful check, PCs can still hear the voice but are able to clear their minds long enough to break free from the hold of the song. Lots of footprints are seen going in that direction.",

      "A Stalagmite covered in bent pennies. It looks like passers by have jammed the edges of pennies and other small coins into the cracks and irregularities and bent them down to create an almost scale-effect. Over the years more calcium has been deposited on the pennies, trapping them within. New pennies were jammed between other calcified pennies, and so on, growing the stalagmite over time.",
      "The path here has been replaced with smooth stone squares alternating with squares of polished marble and rough stone in a checkerboard pattern. The whole pattern is irregular at the edges, longer but thinner than a true checkerboard.",
      "A vast collection of lamps and lanterns have been hung around the ceiling and walls, some hung from iron rods, some placed directly on the ground. No two lamps are the same, some are iron, some wood, some paper, some ornate, some elaborate, some elven, some dwarven.",
      "A dense fog has settled in this area of the naturally formed cavern, limiting visibility. It is not obvious what is causing the fog. You are only able to see the person in front of you, everything beyond is nothing more than a shadow, or a sound. Every so often you happen upon a skeleton, bowing in prayer.",
      "The tunnel widens out into a circular room. At the center a raised dais fountain pours with mirror-smooth water before cascading over the edge. The water supports a single black gazing ball, gently rotating.",
      "The stone striations and inclusions of the walls and ceiling have all been engraved with small signs, in sturdy print. The signs name the stones, construction usage and religious properties.",
      "The path intersects with a calm subterranean river where a flat disc of stone, about 10' across, is floating at the water's edge. The river is causing the stone to rotate but it is caught in place by an outcrop of rock. As the river rotates the stone disc the disc grinds out more of the rock it has caught on. It has clearly been here for years as the stone it is stuck on has a sizable divot formed from the rotation.",
      "The mushrooms growing in this tall wet cavern reach up to the ceiling on tiny, spindly stalks. The caps are wide, some spanning to 5 feet, and each one is populated by an ecosystem of bioluminescent bugs. The stalks reach up overhead 10 to 20 feet high, but the diameter of the stalk is merely a few inches. Damaging any of these mushroom stalks causes them to collapse under their own fragility.",
      "Several glass windows in iron frames have been scattered around this tunnel, leaned against stones and laying on the ground.",
      "The walls begin to bulge inwards and you start to notice Large round stones littering the way forward. Continuing on is difficult terrain just due to the sheer number of round stones. After several minutes of struggling you come upon a clearing where several hammers and cracked stones are laid out on a blanket. Each round stone is a geode, able to be cracked with the hammer. They are beautiful, but cumbersome.",
      "The tunnel, once clearly formed by people, is covered in spider web fractures. Each fracture is filled in with a piping of gold, holding the structure together. It seems as though the tunnel collapsed at one point, and then was repaired in this ornate manner.",
      "The path here dips down between an outcrop of stone that is densely covered in mosses and ferns. As the trail moves down, the stones raise up, towering far overhead yet still close enough to touch. At the nadir of the path a wooden bridge zigzags through two massive mossy stones. The railings of the bridge have stone pillars arranged in a fan pattern. Water drips down from the moss onto the passers of the bridge. The bridge crosses a skinny creek before the path slopes upwards again.",
      "Within a large open cavern the path happens upon a low wall made of loose stones. The wall is easy enough to hop over, but the path follows along only one side of the wall. After a few minutes of walking, a stone arched Moon Gate has been made, which the path follows through and continues onward.",
      "You come upon an oblong stone propped up vertically in the mosses. At its base, other oblong stones have been placed on the ground in a radiating sun pattern, all pointing toward the vertical stone. As the tunnel progresses two more of these sculptures can be seen, though one of them was a great distance away from the path in a branching tunnel.",
      "Someone has carved out a lattice roof to cover this section of path. From it The moss 'Old Man's Beard' grows, hanging down long white tendrils. Small round lanterns have been hung in between the mosses, but they are unlit.",
      "The base of a massive igneous inclusion has been decorated with illusory moths, with iridescent white wings. The moths are fluttering while clumped all over the stone so that the rock cannot even be seen. They only cover it in patches, with small trails of fluttering moths reaching up the pillar.",
      "Perfectly clear glass mushrooms have been placed throughout the cavern around the trail, almost imperceptible but for their odd distortions of the stone.",
      "Several lanterns have been hung along the trail here. All of them are made of downward drooping blue leaves or flower petals, with the gently hovering lights trapped within the bundle of leaves. The leaves are wrapped with black iron which is then formed into a hook so the lanterns can be easily hung from the hooks above.",
      "You pass through a cavern that seems to have been darkened by magical means. Any light will only reach out about 5' from the source, and light from sources you are not holding is invisible to you. From sound alone it is clear that there is a rushing stream, a cascading waterfall, and several winged animals flapping. Your footsteps echo through the black cavern, from the sound of it, the cavern is massive. The path crosses the stream at one point, and the water reaches up to your knees. Otherwise, the path is easy to follow in the dark.",
      "The path has been lined with hanging wrought iron bird cages. The cage doors are all open and plants are growing inside, of all different types.",
      "In this stretch of wide tunnel crystal formations reach from floor to ceiling, from wall to wall and jut out at odd angles, completely interrupting the path. The Crystals span the full width of the cave and are at least 3 feet in diameter. To continue the party must climb over the crystals.",
      "At first glance the walls appear to have shifted from smooth stone, worn away by wind or water, to layered sandstone conglomerate, almost like bricks. On closer inspection still these are not bricks at all, but books, layered with their pages facing into the tunnel and then carved out to form the tunnel. Each book appears to have been ruined with time and exposure to the wet cavern.",
      "The path rounds a turn and opens into a massive cavern. A stepped tower ruin made of stone juts up to touch the ceiling. Where stone has broken down, letting light stream in. The tower is weathered and crumbling, and nothing can be found inside, but the sight is impressive.",
      "The cavern ahead is tall and wide, lined with regularly spaced columns of white stone. The columns are smooth and splay outward into the ceiling or floor in a smooth arc. There are no decorations, rooms, objects, or wide spaces, only regular columns.",
      "A small marble rotunda has been built at the edge of a subterranean river. It seats three comfortably but offers no shelter from the dripping cave as the roof is made of latticed iron. At the center of the rotunda is a small statue of a cat holding a fish in its mouth proudly.",
      "Along the low cavern ceiling someone has taken differently colored stones and attached them to the ceiling to look like a clear night sky. Several well known constellations can be seen in their work.",
      "The path is unkempt, but you happen upon a short wide staircase, regal enough for any king. The staircase is 10 steps tall and wide enough for 5. Carvings of mushrooms cavern creatures decorate the sides. Someone has come through and pried all the gems from their eyes and the gold plating from the staircase in general, but the impressive stonework remains. The staircase connects to a higher portion of the path, which continues on as normal.",
      "The path begins to steepen, with roughly formed stairs leading the way. It takes a sharp hairpin bend to proceed. At the inner bend of their hairpin is a carefully carved statue of a man, holding a ferret in his arms. Several candles have been lit and placed all over the statue.",
      "Immediately the cavern appears off to you, and it only takes a few seconds to place it, the stalagmites and stalactites, usually chaotic formations over thousands of years, have been replaced with some mockery. Tall stone cones, perfectly smooth, reach up and down through this cave. It is like someone wanted to create a cavern without knowing what one really looked like.",
      "The path leads up a set of thin stairs, into a very narrow cavern which continues for ten feet before opening up again. Inside the narrow space many passers by have left behind graffiti.",
      "The cavern becomes tight and difficult for tall or heavily armored people to pass through. As you squeeze through the pathway you notice that the walls, path and ceiling are all composed of life size, roughly made, doll parts. The heads all appear to be missing.",
      "The crystal formations in the cave are small and colorful, appearing every so often from the stone walls. Someone has come through this part of the tunnel and carved each formation into tiny, delicate stone flowers, without removing the crystal from where it formed.",
      "The cavernous trail becomes grassy and lush, though the cave remains overhead. After a few minutes or so of this lush tunnel it opens up into what appears to be a clearing with a single wooden gazebo at the center, covered in flowers in full bloom. Benches all around the gazebo have been placed to support a large audience. The cavern overhead is cracked, and light streams in.",
      "The path leads along a rocky creek, flowing with crisp water. After half a mile the source of the creek is found, flowing from the palm of a massive hand carved of stone. The hand is recessed in the stone and shadowy. It gently tips water on top of a single juvenile tree. The stones all around the hand and water are thick with dark mosses.",
      "The cavern tunnel has become covered in small crystal points, like the inside of a geode. After some time the crystalline tunnel curves to meet a small river running underground. No moss or algae can find purchase on the smooth crystal, and the water flows crisp and clear among the points.",
      "The path curves underneath an outcrop of blue glowing mushrooms, whose luminescent spores waft down onto the cavern floor. Several bats flitter from wall to wall catching the spores in their mouths.",
      "The path gives way to a long line of wooden discs carved from tree trunks, lined end to end for at least a mile of trail.",
      "Sculptures of hands can be found along this natural cave path. A series of cupped hands, carved of stone, holding forest plants in full bloom, despite the dark. Several hands protruding from the walls in a ladder pattern, granting access to small cavern rooms and ledges. One giant hand laid against the cave wall with a cavern map painted on the palm. A pair of huge hands, tented together to form a house, or shelter, with some camping amenities below.",
      "The trail becomes unnaturally dark, and rushing water can be heard. With meager light you can see that it curves past a waterfall before cutting up through the stone. Right before the staircase begins the stone landing has been carved into a viewing point for the falls, with dwarven cut banisters, but your light can only illuminate a fraction of the view.",
      "Though the path continues to the left, a wide cavern to the right has caved in, leaving a massive circle of light from the surface down. Roots and mosses drip down into the hole, and the floor of the cavern slowly slopes upward, covered in wild plants and fluttering with birds. A small branching trail leads towards the overgrown cave-in. Along this trail, tall thin grave markers have been placed.",
      "The path through an open cavern approaches a pond. The pond is perfectly square around the outside, and the path moves over the pond, on a series of rough laid stones covered in mosses, in a curved pattern. Branching off the path at regular intervals are tight spirals of stone. The pond is smooth and several glowing Koi fish can be seen swimming in the clear water.",
      "The tunnel opens up into a low, wide cavern, and a strong wind blows through here at odd intervals. On the ceiling, what appear to be naturally formed stone columns have been hollowed out by hand to different depths. The result; when the wind blows through the cavern a deep, haunting drone is made be the ceiling itself.",
      "The ground is wet and muddy with dripping water. As you continue on you come upon a deck of cards that has been scattered, some cards in the trail, some in cracks in the stone, some half buried, but all of them are clean and pristine. If the party manages to gather all the cards, they immediately rescatter from the holder's hand, all over the cavern once again.",
      "A single tree far off in the middle of a huge dark cavern, shimmers with refracted light. On closer inspection the whole tree appears to have been carved from a massive deep blue tourmaline.",
      "Someone has put down mile markers along the trail, big slabs of local stone with carefully carved dwarven numbers. They are not evenly spaced though, and don't seem to accurately reflect distance at all.",
      "A statue of an angel with a large stone sword stands in an alcove to the right of the trail. Several small pouches have been laid at its feet.",
      "From the ceiling a massive root has broken through the solid stone, leaving fissures and cracks as it reaches down. At the same place, from the floor, a root has broken upwards to the same effect. The roots have curled and spiraled around one another in the middle, interrupting the path. They appear to be from different species of tree.",
      "The tunnel path has run into a low, calm creek with a bottom of smooth flat stone. The water is only about calf-high. Walking in the water is soothing and invigorating. However every so often the creek bed is marred with deep (20+ yard) stone holes, perfectly circular.",
      "At the center of this cavern, lit from below by a series of bioluminescent ferns, is a stone sphere. The sphere is of different material than the surrounding stone. Additionally, the inside of the stone has been carved out, a set of stairs leads up into the center, where a raised altar has been carved, then another set of stone stairs leads out of the sphere.",
      "The trail opens up into a wide cavern dimly lit by glowing spheres. The pathway enters into the beginning of a maze. Through the maze can still be followed it looks like someone or something has simply obliterated a straight line right to the other side.",
      "The cavern is immensely tall, easily 100 feet high or more. At the top of this massive cavern wall you can clearly see a single window, lit from the inside. After looking for a while, the light goes out and the window disappears.",
      "Someone has placed massive glowing spheres merged with the stone and stalactites nearby. The spheres glow a blue-green and range from one foot to 4 feet in diameter. Some are high up in stone outcrops on the ceiling, some tucked the worn stone path below.",
      "In the wide cavern with a rushing underground stream something vaguely humanoid catches your eye, just for a moment. It is deep beyond the trail but, moving your head slightly, you can just barely make the outline of a person. If the party inspects further they will find a human sized sculpture made entirely of a mirrored surface, to reflect the cavern around them.",
      "The tunnel opens into a huge cavern full of massive trees. Broken pottery scatters the ground. Pieces of broken flower pots lay all around the roots of the trees here, giving the sense that these trees burst out of their former containers rather quickly.",
      "From far off you can hear the sound of falling water. Light up ahead seems to betray and exit to the cavern, but as you arrive you see that a waterfall has cut through the ceiling, and again through the floor. Peering down, you can see that the waterfall has cut through many other tunnels below, and there is no clear way to the surface.",
      "The natural cavern opens out into a wide hallway, clearly carved from the surrounding stone long ago. The ceiling is now at least 50 feet overhead and massive pillars support it from below. Thin staircases cover the pillars and walls, leading to small alcoves.",
      "A band of bright lit stone forms overhead, lighting the tunnel. Someone has planted a row of rose bushes on either side of the tunnel, the roses are in full, brilliant bloom.",
      "The cavern that appeared to be naturally formed has shifted toward a man-made tunnel. The floor is flat, and the ceiling is a perfectly curved arch. Every foot or so the stone of the walls changes, from slate, or limestone, to moss agate, to obsidian, etc. Each stone section fits perfectly with those next to it.",
      "The cavern path dips down under the surface of a calm subterranean lake, it is easy to see it continue underwater and then reemerge on the other side of the lake. It looks like the only way across is to swim. The water's surface is not calm though, perhaps the ceiling is dripping and disturbing the dark water?",
      "The cavern here is made entirely of chalk. It wouldn't be hard to break off a chunk , and in fact it looks like several adventurers before you have done just that. In the tunnels beyond, chalk graffiti is quite common.",
      "Ahead you can see odd crystal formations in the tunnel, they are flat and wide, and reach down from the tunnel ceiling, but none jut up from the floor. The floor remains flat and clear. The crystals force the tunnel to shrink, making the party proceed in single file. In places the crystals come down quite far, and elsewhere they are at least 30 feet overhead. Upon close inspection, or if anyone touches the 'crystals' they will realize these are not crystals at all, but pieces of glistening fabric. This was never a tunnel at all, but a wide cavern, completely packed with these hanging strips of fabric.",
      "The cave opens into a subterranean room, carved out intentionally, but not cleanly ? it is irregular in shape and through the floor is flat the walls and ceiling are not. There is nothing in this room except for a 20' circular raised platform bearing a wide array of mosses.",
      "A large red clay pot has been placed on its side at the top of a nearby underground spring. The back of the pot has been removed to let water flow in, changing the water's course to flow out of the mouth of the pot, giving the effect of constant pouring.",
      "In the nearby stone and crystal pillars, naturally formed, are various carvings. Some are plants and trees, some are animals and fish. Each carving is done expertly. In the middle of a large group of carved plants is a carving of a person whose joints appear to be that of a mechanical doll's. It's face is a plain featureless mask.",
      "A geyser erupts every few minutes along the pathside in this cave. It strikes the low ceiling, just as it has been for hundreds of years. A sizeable hole has formed in the stone above where the water strikes, and now, when the water strikes the top, the hole forces the water to flow down in a domed shape. The water is hot, but not scalding.",
      "The trail passes through a low, wide cavern which is full of water. Floating on the water's surface are thousands of large blooming flowers. At the base of each blossom a silver ring fits snugly. Removing the ring causes the blossom to wither and die. You must wade through the flowering lake to continue on the path.",
      "Ahead the stone tunnel trail gives way down a steep cliff with a descending staircase. Along the way, several man-made turquoise pools of water cascade down into one another from a local spring. The pools each feed into one another and have a submerged bench to seat between 5 and 10. No other people can be seen.",
      "You began noticing a few spider webs catching drips of water from the ceiling. The webbing becomes more and more common and as it does, the strands shimmer with iridescent color. After a while thick and heavy opal strands drape over the trail like blankets. Eventually the webbing fades like it appeared, and the trail is clear again. The next time you inspect your pack, you find a 30' coil of strong silken rope.",
      "The trail passes by a pocket cavern off the main tunnel with a circle statues of delvers in poses of laughter, trade, or rest. All of them appear happy. Each one has a real backpack, though some are rotting off. Many of the backpacks contain small offerings, perhaps left by passing adventurers?",
      "The natural tunnel is bisected by a subterranean ice flow. Some time ago, perhaps years, the ice was carved through by some adventurer to continue on to the rest of the tunnel, but the slow moving ice has pushed that tunnel down-flow. The entrance of the tunnel is no more than a foot and a half wide, and will need to be cut to accommodate anyone larger. The ice tunnel beyond is spacious, but the exit, once again, is tight.",
      "The tunnel passes through an immensely tall skinny hole, leading towards daylight. Bats cover the ceiling, squeaking and fluttering around. Peering outside you see this rift is at least 100 feet up the side of a sheer cliff, overlooking jungle.",
      "You happen across a long bridge spanning a chasm. Glancing to the northeast you see another bridge, made of a massive stone slab, overgrown with moss. A procession of drow crosses the bridge in silence. When they reach the other side you can no longer see them.",
      "You hear the sound of distant creaking. Perception check to spot, deep in the dark cavern, a structure. Far off the trail is a calcified sailing ship, sails heavy with water. There is a large hole in the hull. Stalagmites have formed on the ships surface and a wet algae has grown across everything.",
      "Calcium deposits are prevalent in this cavern, but up ahead an old stalagmite and stalactite have met in the middle of the tunnel. Just before touching someone has placed a smooth sphere of precious stone, and now the calcium has begun to form around the outside, holding it in place.",
      "A gigantic jawbone is arched over the trail, over the party's heads with room to spare. Glistening strings with blown glass stars have been hung from various points on the teeth.",
      "The tunnel floor comes upon a circular puddle full of dark water. Trying to touch the water reveals the 'puddle' is actually a very deep borehole reaching down 50 feet. At the bottom of this hole are several adventurer bones and any supplies not ruined by water.",
      "The trail passes by half a stone face carved from a boulder, Just this half of the face is taller than any party member. A mile down the trail, the other half of the face. Farther still, a hand holding a sword hilt and the broken fragments of sword. Then another hand holding onto a lantern the size of a small house, lit by some magical force. The stones around the lantern glow with a pulsating rhythm.",
      "While the cave wall to the left is rough and craggy, to the right the wall is smooth, bulging out slightly. As you continue the smooth wall changes pattern over the course of half a mile of perfectly straight cavern. By the end you have an idea of what it is and your theory is confirmed with you see the huge face. The 'wall' was a gigantic fallen statue of a person. The only exposed eye, larger than your whole body, appears to be hinged like a door. A small room can be found beyond.",
      "The trail passes by a circular mirror which is being held from behind by a statue. The Statue depicts a man in a cloak with an impossibly long neck and the face of a barn owl, peering over the top of the mirror and gazing at itself.",
      "Along the trail are spheres of iron, hollow on the inside about 2 feet in diameter. The iron shell has been cut out to show a forest scene made in metal, each sphere has a different scene. Someone has set a campfire inside each. The fire on the inside of the sculpture backlights the iron cutouts, and lights the tunnel.",
      "The tunnel is cut by a fissure in the stone, one foot across, and spanning into the stone an unknown distance. The fissure is well lit by a magma flow running down one side of the fissure and along the bottom, but the magma is at least 10 yards away from the tunnel and poses no risk. The heat causes strong winds to blow through this fissure and through the tunnel. The jump across is easy.",
      "The entire tunnel has two fissures running along it, horizontally. This causes one whole layer, or strata, to be offset from the other walls by a foot. It appears as though a portion of the stone was simply pushed out of alignment.",
      "A sculpture of a giant metal key leans against a plain wall. It is labeled ?Important?",
      "In an expansive cave on either side of the trail Two massive stone wings have been placed, reaching toward a vein of black stone in the ceiling.",
      "A massive circle of obsidian, about 20 feet across, has been placed in an alcove just off the trail. It is elevated off the ground about 2 feet, held up by carved stone legs. Condensing moisture in the air has filled the slightly concave surface with perfectly smooth reflective water. After looking for a moment, a drop of water falls, disturbing the smooth surface.",
      "Rather than building a bridge over the top of this subterranean stream, someone has tunneled underneath. Inside the tunnel is lit by a cluster of luminescent moths.",
      "This stretch of tunnel is scorched, as though a fire has recently passed through. In fact, a few burning embers and hot stones can still be found. The mosses here are still smoking. Interestingly the smoke of the mosses is pleasant, like incense, and fills the cavern with flowery smoke.",
      "Several animal skulls are piled along the tunnel. Each one has been delicately carved with an intricate pattern, without losing the structural integrity of the skulls.",
      "At a bend in the trail, just off to the right, someone has placed a perfectly smooth cylinder of white marble, 7 feet tall. Walking around to the back of the cylinder reveals a highly detailed face has been carved into a deep crack in the marble.",
      "A massive illusionary koi fish swims through this cavern. Every so often it dips down to pass right through the party. Each time it does, the air smells of fresh mint.",
      "Someone has taken the heads of old broken shovels and attached them at the base to make a huge metal pine cone. Then they placed smack in the middle of this tunnel, for some reason.",
      "At first you think perhaps someone has spilled a bag of coins, but you realize that the scattered coins get more and more dense, almost like a mosaic. For about 10 yards the trail is perfectly paved with coins before the trail peters out again. The coins here appear to be from all different regions, in small denominations. Should you leave some coins to further the trail too?",
      "Through the dark cavern you can hear the sound of ocean waves, and begin to smell salt air. Rounding a corner, you can feel sand underfoot. Inside this pitch black cave the ocean laps at the shore.",
      "A stray dog wanders up to you on the trail and decides to walk with you. He has a red bandana tied around his neck. After about a mile or so he wanders off again, down a branching fork in the tunnel.",
      "The trail has become a stone hopscotch board.",
      "Passing by a wide stream you spy a cat walking into the water. To your shock the water arcs around the cat, keeping it perfectly dry. With a deft swipe the cat snatches a fish from the water wall in front of it, and leaves the stream, still dry, now fed.",
      "Ahead you can hear the clink and jangle of falling pebbles. Rounding a bend in the trail, a cascade of smooth beach glass pours from a fissure in the wall, flows over the path, and continues on down another crack in the wall.",
      "The cavern walls have fossil imprints regularly. Among the fossils you may find; a giant dragonfly wing, 10 feet long. A series of tiny hand bones. The complete skeleton of a large lizard like creature with huge horns. Several hard-shelled beetles, a up to a foot in size. The ?bones? of a porcelain mechanical doll, with a mask in the place of the head. One stone crack is filled with spiraling ridged shell fossils.",
      "The path opens up into a carved out grotto where several gigantic metal rings support celestial sculptures. The Sun and Moon are represented by colorful and bright spheres carved to resemble the faces of two women. Other planets and important stars have their own rings. It appears that the rings move in time with the celestial bodies, accurately depicting their position from the perspective of someone at the center of the sculpture.",
      "The tunnel slopes downward before ending in a hole, about 10 feet across. Several sturdy metal hooks are in place and at least one already has a rope attached, though the durability of the old rope is questionable. Peering through the hole, you can see the roof of a sizeable castle, with towers reaching up to just under the hole, it would be risky to jump, but plausible. Through other holes in this cavern ceiling waterfalls pour into the castle. The sturdy stonework of the castle has resulted in flooding from the waterfalls. Each room holds a few inches to several feet of water. One windowless tower door was so well made that the full tower was flooded, and now water cascades from the top down the stonework and into the courtyard. Water cascades down the grand staircase to the entrance. The courtyard, surrounded by a low circular wall, is now an algae filled pond, full of cave fish. Outside this castle pond, overflow rivers converge and continue on into the cave."

      "A lens which when looked through allows one to see hidden doors, passages, etc. in the dungeon, but using it also lets you see the insubstantial monsters lurking about, who consider being seen a grievous offense. The longer you look through the lens, the higher the risk they notice you looking.",
      "A statue next to a locked door. The statue has a gem for one eye, and the other is missing. Taking the gem releases a cloud of poison gas from the hollow in the statue's head.

Smashing through the pipes will release a huge cloud of steam and reduce visibility for everyone on this level of the dungeon, but stop the steam releases.",
      "A monkey statue with its hands over its eyes. Looking at the statue causes it to shudder. Looking for more than a few seconds causes it to animate and attack until it's destroyed or everyone present looks away for a few seconds. A hostile goblin is standing with its back to the statue.",

      "A Mexican stand-off between three pirates, a recently-unburied chest full of booty in the middle of them.",
      "A worn-away wisp of a dryad, clinging to the driftwood which was once her tree. Will try to commit suicide-by-adventurer by convincing them she's more dangerous than she is to end her agony. If her bluff is called and she's shuffled gently off this mortal coil, the dryad's driftwood splits open to reveal a magic seed.",
      "A smuggler in a heavy cloak and a rowboat that seems too rotten to float. Direct light will reveal the smuggler's true, skeletal face. She discovered a treacherous route out of the underworld then decided to continue the profession she followed in life. The dead smuggler offers goods not found among the living, and attempts to rope you into her schemes.",
      "The sand in this section of beach is greyish-red, iron-like, magnetically anomalous. Carrying ferrous metal through it can kick up obscuring clouds and rasping sandstorms.",
      "A man in a suit of armour sitting on a stone. Not really a man at all, but a knight-crab (like a hermit crab, but bigger, more dangerous, and uses armour instead of shells to house its vulnerable parts) grown a bit too large for its current home and looking to upgrade. Will mimic human behaviour as well as a clever animal can to lure prey closer before it attacks.",
      "An idol of verdigrised bronze half-buried in the sand. Time and water have worn away its features to the point that you can't tell whether it was supposed to look angelic or demonic.",
      "Goblins racing wheels and wagons down the slope of the waterline. They won't let you pass unless you beat them at their own race. Materials for a vehicle will be provided, including: old planks, nails, an inflated pig skin, and very hard melons. Sabotage of other racers is not only allowed, it's encouraged.",
      "A sea-hag crouches in the water, combing tangles from her hair. She's self-serving, always hungry, and morbidly humourous, but willing to barter fresh flesh and magical objects for her services and charms. The hag will die if her hair ever dries out.",
      "A worn leather case containing a smeared and mildewed scroll bobs in the waves. The scroll contains a random spell, but the damage to the scroll will mess with its activation. Maybe it'll fizzle out, or affect a different target, or even become more powerful.",
      "A rusted machine. Its gears turn so slowly that the movement is nearly imperceptible, its ticking seeming perhaps to be your imagination. It will finally wind down in a matter of hours, and when it does it will explode. With tools (or fingers you don't mind getting pinched off) the gears can be manually re- or unwound. Immersing the machine in water will delay its detonation indefinitely.",
      "A shark-man brute leaps from the water, positioning itself so that dazzling, blinding light shines off the surface at its back and into your face. Tries to intimidate its way to a toll of wealth and rations, fights reluctantly.",

      "Hungry beachworms tunnelling below, bulging the sand above their passage. They can't dig through solid rock, but are fast enough to overtake a running person. The sand above softens any blows against them except for when they lunge or watch periscope-like for prey.",
      "Galumphing kelp-freits wielding enormous shell-and-bone scissors. They work to separate the abominable in-betweens of land and sea: amphibians, sailors, seagulls, and so on, with the edge of their scissors if necessary (it's most often necessary). The kelp-freits try to set up flanks between themselves, so they can combine their scissors to gruesome amputative effect.",
      "A drunken giant building an equally giant sandcastle. It's dangerously oblivious in its scooping and molding, and if pestered will demand you act out its imaginings of what life in a castle is like with the frightened prisoners the giant's already captured.",
      "A big, stoic sandstone face carved into the side of a hill. It will open its mouth to the treasure stashed within only for the person it was carved to resemble. The enchantment on it is rather crude, so a mask painted to look like it, its reflection in a mirror, and the like would all be sufficient to fool the face into opening. Dynamite will also open the face, but risks damaging the treasure within.",
      "A discarded coffer full of cursed silver coins. If carried they'll tarnish any other precious metals you touch, and will return to your possession the night after you spend them. They'll appear in your mouth if you've got no bags or pockets for them.",
      "A group of young nobles play polo as their bodyguards watch on. They're growing bored with their game and eager for new amusements. They nobles unfamiliar with the possibility of their actions having negative consequences.

      "A decrepit yacht drifting down the shore. Its undead passengers believe themselves to still be alive and at an upscale party, dancing and drinking from dusty glasses.

      "A storm tears through the area, coming and going in maelstromous moments. Soon after the storm passes, a party of fairies riding albatrosses swoop down and ask which direction their quarry went.

If they're lied to you'll find yourself caught in a deluge every time you try to sleep outside for the next month.",

      "A collection of jars, some shattered, some whole, all caught in some muck. Within them is some goo. Drinking the goo inflicts a piscine mutation: gills, bulging eyes, legs fused into fins, skin turned to scales, and so on. Each jar's goo inflicts a single mutation.",
      "An estuary where crocodiles lurk.",
      "A basket bobbing in the sea foam. Within is a wailing baby, several items of golden jewelry, and a note. The note explains that the baby is the youngest son of a king, sent downriver to escape the murderous attention of the crown prince. It further implores its reader to raise the baby well, take the jewelry as payment (though leaving one piece as a keepsake), and some day tell them of their royal heritage and duty to overthrow their tyrannous sibling.",

      "Coral mounds dot this place and strange fish swim through the air. This is the ghost of an ancient reef now on land by the long movement of geology, lost in the memory of life. The ghostly animals behave as they would while alive, including attacking when hungry or provoked.",
      "Someone's drowning, caught in a riptide. If rescued they'll be grateful, but don't have much to offer besides their service.",
      "A friendly horse trots up the beach to you. It's a kelpie in disguise. If touched you'll stick to it and it'll gallop into the water.",
      "A floating dock that trails out to a prime fishing spot.",
      "A fresh shipwreck. There's a three-way argument between some human scavengers, goblins, and fish-men as to how to split the spoils. They haven't come to blows yet, but they're close.",
      "A desiccated ocean chimera (eel for a tail, heads from a turtle, a pufferfish, and a seahorse, body like all four mashed together, breathes gouts of inky venom) placed above the high tide line. Contact with water will restore it instantly to lively hostility.",

      "Colourful, frilly seaslug-men crowd around you and probe with soft appendages, babbling all the while. They're tourists from the undersea realms. Curious about you, but unable to speak your language, and assume their gesticulations are more comprehensible than they are. At the first sign of violence they'll vomit their guts out and crawl over each other to get back in the ocean.",

      "A salt evaporation pond. People from a nearby village sing work songs as they dredge the salt.",
      "An abandoned, algae-encrusted net. Entangled in it is a fish-bitten revenant on a quest to avenge its own murder, stymied by the fact that its hands and tongue have been eaten off.",
      "Gems ground to dust have been mixed into the sand here, glittering in ruby and sapphire hues. It'd be valuable but time consuming to sift it out here, but this risks attracting the attention of wandering monsters. The mixed sand could be packed up to be sifted elsewhere, but the ratio of sand-to-gem-dust could make it prohibitively heavy.",
      "A lifelike, gently smiling statue carved from salt, up to its knees in the sand. Those within the statue's field of view (if its eyes could see) receive a penalty to their ability to resist outside influences on their mind.",
      "A fishing ogre with waves lapping at its shins. The ogre is currently distracted wrestling with a shark that's bitten its line.",
      "A lightly sleeping lion-naga basking on the sun-warmed sand.",

      "The sea foam's piled ashore here over your head, and widely enough that you can't easily walk around it. Easy enough to push through it, but you can't see in it past your nose. Something's hiding in the foam, waiting for prey to wander in.",

      "Goblins training gulls to shit in peoples' eyes.",
      "A red tide laps at the shore. It's infested with vampiric, symbiotic algae. A gaggle of infested people (evident by their crimson eyes and veins) are bathing in the stuff. They try to ply you with drugs and good company to offer up some blood (any sort will do), and become increasingly agitated if you do not. Their preferred mode of attack is to spike the dose of whatever they can get you to take with a sedative and drain you while you're passed out.",
      "A sea turtle nesting site. You've arrived at just the right time to see the mass hatching. Predators will be gathering soon to pick off the baby turtles before they reach the water. Maybe you'll be joining them.",
      "A sudden fog rolls in. Vague lights can be seen through it. Lanterns? Will-o'-wisps? Lures? Perhaps it's better to avoid them than investigate.",

      "A nuckalavee charges from the surf. A tireless pursuer, but can't cross freshwater.",
      "A resplendent coconut palm held sacred by local people. They know, but don't speak openly of, a ritual by which you can remove an evil presence from someone's mind (possession, madness, domination, enchantment, etc.) by trepanning them, drilling to the core of a coconut from the sacred palm, and placing the holes together to draw the evil presence from their head and into the coconut. Trees grown from coconuts used in the ritual are twisted things, bearing the mark of the evil they contained.",
      "A group clad in immaculate white robes, browbeating some reluctant few members into following them willingly into the ocean. Apparently a suicide cult. Non-members are proselytized to, and asked not to interfere.",

      "A fisher-monk stands posed upon a rock in impossible stillness, wielding a barbed harpoon. He waits for the vanishingly rare rainbow-urchin to pass by, a creature with spines of light of every hue and shade. When he spots it he'll strike with unerring precision. If interrupted before then the monk will be incomprehensibly salty.",
      "Sargasso spreads before you, from the beach to the distant horizon. Everything you've ever lost beckons from its green tangles. This is a portal to the Sargassium, a world where all things can be found again, or where you too might be lost forever.",
      "The water withdraws, the horizon swells. A tidal wave is coming.",
      "A fish-man flags you down, says they were supposed to meet with a representative from a nearby village to discuss trade agreements, tribute, and breeding rights. As that representative is late, the fish-man explains, you will have to do. Some time in to the negotiation (or fighting, or whatever else) the representative will arrive and react to you based on how you've argued for the village's interests.",
      "You glimpse a howling whirlpool and waltzing waterspouts a long way from the shore. The visible surface signs of the weapons of an underwater war.",
      "While walking along on the sand, you suddenly look down and see a turtle crawling toward you. You reach down and flip it over onto its back. The turtle lies there, its belly baking in the hot sun, beating its flippers, trying to turn itself over, but it cannot do so without your help. You are not helping. Why?"

      "Deep in the forest, approaching dusk, the party finds a logging camp. Several small cabins and a mill. Smoke curls lazily up from one or two of the chimneys. There is nobody in the camp. There are plates of food on tables, still warm. Clothes on a washing line are still damp. Only the doors into the mill are locked. As night falls, a fierce storm begins to build, and from the mill the saws can be heard rasping back and forth, though they don't sound quite right... ",
      "The party finds a scraggly, disheveled child apparently lost in the forest. It asks the party for help, should the party agree, they come under the effects of a curse until they defeat the child (Actually a restless Evil) who flees, attempting to lead them into a hazard deeper in the forest.",
      "Small dolls sit in a tree the players pass by. They are wearing crude clothes, and don sticks of specific lengths. Poor perception rolls feel anonymous sets of eyes gazing at you, while good perception rolls can discover them. These dolls, if ignored, will appear again in a different tree a few feet up, requiring lower rolls as they subtly make themselves more obvious. Upon the first investigation, you find that the dolls are poorly stitched together, with leaves still poking out of the burlap fabric, and expressionless faces with small stones as eyes. However, with each successive perception roll as the party walks away, the dolls become slightly more realistic. On additional rolls their rock-eyes appear to follow you (Mona Lisa style), their skin becomes taut and leathery, and their clothes become more realistic. Repeat as necessary, with the players unable to leave a small section of the forest (due to magical barriers, or because walking straight forward keeps leading them back to the same spots.) Eventually, all of the dolls should clearly resemble everyone in the party. It is important that the dolls never appear to move on their own, and in every way act as though an inanimate object would. They can be destroyed, ripped, held, carried, etc. There should also be at least 4 separate perception checks on the dolls IMO. It really draws the frustration out, and that is an expression of fear. The final perception check on the dolls will have the dolls be very hard to find, except by one person, who you can choose beforehand. No matter how well other party members roll, the person you choose will feel a tingling on the back of their neck, and turn around to find the dolls in a high branch. They are nearly perfect mimics of the party, and are standing around the doll that looks like the person who discovered them, whose doll has a thick piece of string around their neck. The person feels paralyzed as the can only just watch due to fear, as time slows around them. The doll-party gazes directly into the player characters real eyes, and gently...  pushes. For extra effect, have a pencil ready to snap upon this moment. Sometimes the cheesy sound effect speaks volumes more than words. The party will usually react at this point, let them destroy the dolls. It's cathartic. If you want to continue the fear though, every one in a while later on, let them see a flicker of movement out of the corner of their eyes. Bonus points if you pick a grunge or mistake to build this off of. Like if a cleric forgets to heal a fighter and the fighter calls, have one of them be the one that pushes the other off, as though the cleric purposely didn't heal, or the fighter was trying to get revenge. If the party has a rogue, have their doll slip a stick in the back of the hanged on. There's a ton of customization you can do, and if done well, you can seed a lot of discord between two player characters and build their relationship to be really dynamic. Happy Creepy Crawlies.",

      "An open clearing shows the remains of several bodies arranged in a glyph like patter. Due to dismemberment and missing pieces you are not sure how many bodies were used. As you review the scene, the trail behind you vanishes and leaves naught but deep and ancient thorn bushes, redolent with the faint reek of decaying flesh.",
      "A medium sized hut made of gingerbread and various pieces of candy. A kindly old woman asks you in for dinner.",
      "A pile of shit with human clothes, hair and bones in.",
      "The party find a clearing with an odd nature alter in the center. While they are distracted, the trees around them move closer. If they are distracted for long enough, the trees form a complete wall. The trees do not attack; they only defend themselves if attacked.",
      "There is a tree with deep scratches in it, as if it has been attacked by a dagger. Upon inspection, the player discovers old, dried blood embedded in the bark and writing in a deep red color that says 'Find me, help me' (illusory script). As the party continues they see more trees of a similar nature, and eventually find a crazed gnome who is determined to eat party members in order to restore his youth.",
      "The path opens into a clearing. Near the center is a unicorn lying down on its side. It looks serene and peaceful. The clearing is bright and quiet. Almost silent but for distant birdsong. If the party approach they realize it is dying. Its throat is torn open by some powerful beast and the wound looks infected or poisoned. The edges of the clearing are creeping in, going brown or fungus laden and choked with weeds and branches, which seem to close in whenever no one is looking in that direction. The unicorn is probably (?) past any help the party can give but may last an hour. Left to its own devices, the clearing will close in maybe 20 minutes.",
      "The trees appear to be leaning closer together and are a different shade of green to normal trees. As a breeze blows they seem to be whispering to each other wisha... wisha... wisha",
      "The undergrowth is thick confining you to a narrow path. It switched sharply left then right... . to a dead end. Turning back it is a dead end that way. The only way forward is to hack through the lower branches and scrub. As the players do, the cut stems ooze blood. If burned instead the wet plants hiss and whistle as they burn sounding like tortured screams.",
      "You begin to notice that everything looks familiar. Slowly it dawns on you that the trees are all identical, right down to that twig that snapped off when it caught on you backpack.",
      "A family of forest giants has caught the scent of the party while hunting. They're catching up.",
      "Disembodied screams echo around you. Ghosts of the past? Or maybe it's Jim the halfling rogue, trying to scare off tourists so he can start a coalmine?",
      "In the distance you see a light. When you get closer you see a lamp hanging from a tree swinging in the wind. It is full of oil but there are no signs of whoever put the lamp there.",
      "You find humanoid skeletons tied together to form the rough shape of a horse. If you use speak with dead on it, it only screams.",
      "You suddenly realize that all the noise in the forest is gone. As if silence had been cast but you can still talk and make noise as normal. Suddenly the forest is filled with howls, screeches, and buzzing so loud it deafens the party. When the party can hear again the forest is back to normal.",
      "You come across a cottage in the woods belonging to a friendly woodsman and his wife. They provide food and shelter for the night. When the party awakes they are in the burned down ruins of a cottage with the skeletal remains of the farmer and his wife reaching desperately for the party.",
      "A hooded figure sits on a stump. He does not respond to anything. If you attack or touch the figure they collapse into a swarm of spiders.",
      "A parrot is found on a branch repeating the words 'Gods what is that?!'",
      "The party finds a wanted poster tacked to a tree with a group shot of the party with a red X marked through two of the party members faces. The party does not remember posing for this picture nor know why they would be wanted.",
      "You come upon a dry riverbed. From the trees lining the banks dangle a hundred mutilated corpses.",
      "Two children play fight with sticks, laughing and taunting each other. When they notice the party watching, they'll happily put on a show. That's when the other children emerge from the trees, only they aren't playing and they've got more than just sticks and stones.",
      "A strangely inviting cave comes in to view. Surely it's some kind of den and we shouldn't go in but I just...  cant... . help it.",
      "From deep within the forest loud clicking and chattering noises of various pitches and tempo can be heard. Upon inspection a small city raiding party dressed in armor have been brutally mutilated with heads twisted round and limbs ripped off. The same clicking noise starts again and gets closer and louder. When it seems like the creature is on top of them it suddenly stops and does not reappear.",
      "It has been at least 24 hours since sunset and it has yet to come back up. What's worse is that all the forest chatter from insects and wildlife has trickled nearly to a standstill save for one slow but consistent crunching that has been following at a distance for hours now. Are the stars even moving anymore?",
      "Early in the day the party passes underneath a suit of armor suspended in the trees, branches occupying the inside of the suit as if they had squeezed out the body that occupied it before. Branches sprout from the facemask wildly, limbs protrude from the leg and armholes, and the entire chest piece is nearly bursting from the volume of foliage it contains.",
      "Just when its time to make camp for the night yet again within the damp cold forest, the party comes across an old house sitting unoccupied in a small clearing. They seek comfort in the house, building a fire in the hearth and drinking some old booze left by previous tenants. Keeping good watch, they peer out the windows frequently. Maybe it's just the old wine but are the trees... . getting closer?",
      "A few chickens are pecking at the dirt in the middle of the trail. When you come upon them, you spook them, and they trot off into the forest a few meters. They resume pecking; but little does anyone know that they've begun to peck seeds that have the effect of the enlarge spell. Treat an enlarged chicken as an allosaurus and let the fun begin.",
      "Glowing eyes stare out of a knothole in an old and gnarled tree. When the players notice it watching, the thing scampers deeper into the tree. If they investigate the knothole they'll find it goes deep, deeper than the tree itself. At the bottom of the hole something glitters. Gold? Many more glowing eyes stare up around it.",
      "A corpse sways in the branches of a lonely willow by a stream, dangling from a noose. The corpse is grinning, and dancing a slow, merry jig.",
      "Something howls in the distance. Another something responds. Not wolves. The howls are too ragged, sound too much like words.",
      "A little twig-and-twine doll is pinned to a branch up ahead. Another just like it can be seen just off the path, and another beyond that one. Even in the depths of the woods you'll be protected so long as you follow them. Your safety once you arrive where they're leading you is less guaranteed. A polite invitation has been extended. It won't come again.",
      "Moaning can be heard from a bush. Within is a hunter, near-death, near incoherent from fear. No mere animal could have inflicted the wounds he bears. They're too precise, suggestive of strange symbols.",
      "The trees in this part of the forest are all wrong. They're growing in neat rows; they sway though there is no wind. Strange fruits swell in their boughs. You've stumbled into an orchard. Were those stones you stepped over a ways back someone's fence?",
      "A boar bursts out of the undergrowth; foaming spittle flecks its tusks. It charges, eyes bloodshot, but makes no move to defend itself. All its attacks seem half-hearted. What drove this beast to seek death so?",
      "Cloying mist drifts into the region. You can barely see five paces ahead of you. Vague, bulbous forms can be seen protruding from the trees as you pass. Fungus. This isn't mist, it's spores.",
      "A fire shines through the trunks a little ways from you. Around it are adventurers, like you, camping for the night. None of them speak the same languages as you. The forest has them spooked, paranoid. They'll welcome familiar company at first, but any number of things you do could set them off.",
      "A pond in a clearing, clean and still. No animal drinks from it, no insects buzz above it. No monsters will approach here beyond the tree line. Is it safe for you to stay here?",
      "The forest path is narrow and overgrown. Looking down the tunnel-like trail gives you vertigo and puts you off balance. Shadows appear to move and you feel like you're just going in circles.",
      "The forest itself seems to be against your presence. Roots seem to spring up to trip you and branches swat at you when moved out of the way. The canopy closes around you shutting out the sunlight.",
      "The players hear footsteps echoing theirs, slightly behind, but the path is empty. Anything they call out is repeated back with missing syllables, as if the voice is in pain.",
      "A child's laughter is heard off of the path, along with a flicker of light, which keeps appearing further away if the party follows. It leads them to the body of an elven boy with an arrow in his back.",
      "One member of the party hears the creaking of the trees and sounds of the forest suddenly stop, then a voice right behind them whispers their name on a hoarse voice, but there is no one there. None of the others notice anything different.",
      "The players hear the sounds of cries and screams from soldiers and the guttural cries of a nightmarish creature echo through the forest. The last one goes quiet before they reach them. If they choose to search, they find scattered around the ground the weather-worn skeletal remains of 16 soldiers from a long-dead empire known for it's brutal methods, some of which are found ripped apart apparently trying to flee.",
      "The players feel as though something is watching them, but can't see anything in the darkness. If they move more than 30ft in any direction they hear rustling following, but no matter how much they search cannot find anything.",
      "A dead character from one of the character's past stands amongst the trees, with the appearance and wounds they had when they died. Only one person can see them. The character doesn't move, but silently watches the player. Any attacks go through them without causing damage. They dissolve into a smoke-like darkness after 1d6 minutes.",
      "The sound of whispering is heard behind a bush. When it is pulled back or someone moves behind it, the whispering stops abruptly and a darkened feather falls slowly to the ground.",
      "A group of little girls are tied to the trees just off of the path, crying quietly. If the party goes to rescue them, they fight being rescued and attempt to escape and retie themselves to the trees, warning that 'the Grogleman' will come for them and their families too if they return home.",
      "A group of giants sit motionless around a giant chessboard, eyes intent on the pieces. Closer examination reveals the three are corpses; fungi grow from their eyelids and out of their hair, and the bodies slump and collapse if touched.",
      "The ground on both sides of the trail seems odd; upon closer examination, it is absolutely swarming with termites, covering the whole ground like a wave. If the party steps off the trail, the insects scatter from the party's feet, leaving strange, momentary footprints in the ground.",
      "Prayers cannot be uttered aloud in the forest; spells can be cast as normal, but any verbal component comes out as a rattling hiss.",
      "A thick fog hovers over the ground, reaching up about two feet (to the chests of any halflings in the party, to the knees of humans). Anyone putting their heads in the fog (bending down to pick something up, etc.) hears muffled screams and far-off voices begging for their lives.",
      "Each person awakes to find a large meat hook carefully placed along on their bedrolls over their stomachs.",
      "In the periphery of the party's vision, the trees that they pass seem to take on the image of a grim army, marching next to the party. When faced directly, the trees seem rather normal. The whole forest smells like a battlefield.",
      "Every time anyone lights a fire in the forest, there is a sudden hissing and smoking from the ground for twenty feet around the sparks. Little red lines appear like veins in the earth before fading to blackness.",
      "A monkey in a Jester's costume comes swinging through the trees, hooting and screeching. If the adventurers catch the monkey, they find a bloody knife stuck in its belt. The monkey stares at them all with a baleful expression.",
      "Crows are screaming at each other as the party enters the woods. Increasingly, the screams sound like words, demanding blood.",
      "The hedge on the side of the trail has strange burn marks in it, almost exactly in the shape of men.",
      "A fox with a bloodied and broken leg comes limping up the path to the party and will pass by it if it can. If anyone speaks to it, the fox changes form into an old druidic woman, who mumbles about the forest being unsalvageable.",
      "As the party walks into the forest, they are greeted by an adventuring group coming the opposite direction. They chat for a little bit, explaining they found the woods too dangerous and are making their way back to whatever town the party has just come from. A little farther into the woods, the party finds the corpses of the same adventuring group, gathered around the sputtering embers of a fire... ",
      "A bucket has been nailed to a tree, with a crude sign saying 'Donations' hanging under it. The bucket is half-filled with fingers and toes in varying levels of freshness.",
      "A small, neat signboard reads, 'Please remain on the path.' The neatness is somewhat marred by the corpses strewn below the sign.",
      "Someone has sharpened the branches around the trail in the forest, so that the trail is surrounded by sharp points.",
      "The party finds themselves staring at a strange tableaux- the corpse of a squirrel is placed next to an acorn, followed by (in order) the corpse of a cat, a dog, a wolf, and a bear. Behind the bear are strange scuffmarks in the dirt, like there was another corpse behind it, this one in the shape of something human... ",
      "As the party walks through the forest, a strange figure suddenly drops from the trees in front of them- upon inspection, it is an effigy in the rough shape of a man, made of wooden boughs and leaves. This happens twice more as they walk. The fourth time, the figure drops down again, but anyone going to clear it away finds that it is actually the corpse of a man this time, with branches lashed to his limbs and a grisly smile on his face... ",
      "A cold mist creeps into the surrounding area, players who breathe it will be asked to make a roll (perception, nature, etc.) but they're making a constitution save with whatever modifier from the false roll. Anyone who rolls above a set DC inhales the mist and is subject to strange illusions.",
      "A hanged man rests on a lone tree. His pockets lined with petty change and a note that appears to be an apology letter to his family.",
      "For an hour of travel there's no sound other than the party.",
      "A section of the forest has been frosted over in what appears to be a permanent winter. The center appears to have an unnatural cave of rocks that don't match anything of the surrounding geological features. Inside features a drop that appears to be without end.",
      "A small portal opens up about 15 ft. above the party, expelling a blood lusted demon to the ground below. It bounces, stunned momentarily before it acquires a new target.",
      "A large head-sized knot in a tree resembles a human face. Wait! The eyes are real: wide, staring, terrified eyes! They look at you as you approach, flicking to each person that talks. But they cannot blink (so cannot communicate in that way), but constantly weep a watery sap.",
      "A large open area. The dirt seems fresher than the rest, no grass growing on the surface. The trees around the edge of the grove are burnt. In the middle sits (1d4) huge skulls, each at least 5 times the height of an average human. These skulls have gashes and claw marks in them, as well as huge spiraling or pointed horns. Scratched into the largest one is 'entrance' in infernal. If the player puts their ear to the ground and listens, they can faintly hear a low rumble that unnerves them to their very core and they don't know why. Digging downwards could potentially reveal a connection between the material plain and one of the evil-aligned outer plains.",
      "The first character to awaken sees a grotesquely exaggerated face hovering inches from their own, glowing weakly with an internal light. An ear-to-ear grin splits the face, revealing a maw with three rows of serrated teeth. When the character blinks, the face disappears. It never appears again.",
      "The party comes across perfectly circle clearing. It's barren waste, nothing ever grows there. Any flora the party might bring with them instantly wilts as it crosses the border. No animal, even as faithful as ranger's companions, can be forced to cross into that circle. If the party decides to spend a night there, they will wake up outside the circle, with all their things scattered across the outer rim of the clearing. If they do it on the night of winter solstice, they will wake up in Avernus instead.",
      "The trees suddenly grow until the sun is blocked out and a magical darkness is cast from somewhere, and whenever the players talk, they hear their words repeated to them in their voice, but can't tell where it's coming from.",
      "The players slowly realize that they are on a loop in the forest. Every night they make camp, then wake up with supplies returned and make the exact same journey again. The players must find the source of this curse and free themselves.",
      "While the party makes camp, someone notices that there is an additional person around the fire. How did no one notice? Why does it smell like rotten meat? And why is it looking at the barbarian like that?",
      "In a less dense part of the forest, where moonlight pours through, the party witnesses a strange hulking creature (Mothman) perched on a tall tree. Its giant red eyes watch the party for a moment, before the creature flies away. The party sees the creature a few more times before coming to a large bridge built over a dangerous river. The creature appears one more time over head, just as the bridge collapses.",
      "After camping in the woods the party awakens to find the trees around them whipping and lashing as if buffeted by strong winds, though the party feels not even a faint breeze. Upon closer inspection, the party notices in mounting horror that the shadows cast by the trees are in the shape of human beings writhing in silent agony.",
      "The party comes across a 50ft circle of pitch-black darkness, with no logical reason as to its existence. Any players that cannot see when in such conditions hear whispers and chattering while in this area, and take 1d6 slashing damage for every round spent there. Any players that can see in such conditions (ex. darkvision) will not suffer any of these effects, and will see that nothing is attacking the others, but rather the wounds are manifesting onto them.",
      "You see corpses pinned to the sharpened boughs and branches of the tress around you, wood puncturing through their throats and sternums. The mottled moonlight filtering through the slowly swaying leaves gives them an eerie sense of motion. A sudden scampering and swish of branches punches through the soft rustling of the trees. Wherever you turn, the sound seems to be coming from behind you, getting closer and closer till you feel a hot, wet breath on the back of your neck. You swing around to confront the horror and see nothing but the corpses in the canopy, leering down at you like demonic pi?atas.",
      "The party stumbles upon a clearing, with a post stamped into the ground. A message scrawled in Primordial reads about a treasure found in the hidden home of squirrels. With a few investigation checks, the party finds an odd tree. Around the back of the tree is a poorly hidden, though hidden, door. The door has no lock on it, but is not open; it has a feeling as though it is stuck. It can be forced open, or pried open, or cut open with fairly decent resistance. Inside is a staircase leading downward, lit by candles embedded in the tree that don't seem like they're burning the tree, though they are quite bright. After a 5-minute descent, the staircase ends in what appears to be a basement. The ceilings drip, and the room is damp and warm. (You can also narrate that the stairs are slippery, and have your players roll athletics not to slip). A decent perception roll can see that the floor and ceiling leak the warm water, without much of a source, while a really good perception check will notice that the color of the environment has become darker, and has a reddish tinge. Otherwise, there appears to be a library or study (whichever is easier for you to narrate.) There are no loose papers or pens and all of the books appear to be locked up, so that they cannot be taken out. A chest in the back can be found, a hair too conspicuously. Upon opening it, there is nothing inside but a pit, that smells of vomit and acid. With that, the room begins to shrink, slowly. The party should discover that they're in the mouth of a giant mimic, who is swallowing them. Upon escaping, the entire tree uproots itself, spits and snarls at the players, and runs away. Best described if you can drop hints about descending the gullet of a beast, such as a hot draft, or distant gurgling.",
      "The party makes camp, and partway through the night, someone on watch starts to get an off feeling. Depending on perception rolls, they may or may not see the eyes watching from up in the trees, though they disappear just after being noticed. Additionally, they may hear the sound of leathery wings gliding through the air above them. Finally, after their defenses being lightly probed/tested, a creature attacks. (IIRC)I used a giant flying chupacabra from PF, but whatever works for you. The creature goes down relatively easily, but as it is struck down, it lets out a piercing scream. As quiet settles, the party hears answering cries from deeper in the woods."

Instead, Hexagramic foundations will boost the magical return of such grisly rituals by an exponential amount.

The accounts of previous openers of the book may be read, but at the cost of the reader's most private life being exposed by the book for all eternity, with a level of detail that only increases the longer the book is left open.

Unattuning kills the person because the artifact can't be unfused from their heart. While attuned to this artifact you have advantage on death saving throws. Also you can open up a portal that leads to the plane of Mechanus or back to the material plane from Mechanus once per day. Modrons recognize Primus' creation and will avoid fights with the person attuned the clockwork heart unless they are attacked. Once a creature has attuned to the Clockwork Heart, they begin to gradually lose the ability to feel emotion and instead become more logical. The process is slow, but speeds up significantly whenever an aspect of the heart is used (such as opening a portal to Mechanus or making a death saving throw only because of the advantage provided by the artifact). At the end of the process, the creature will be completely unable to experience any emotion and will become a logic-centered being.",

The mirror itself can also cast various mind control spells on targets visible in the mirror at the user's behest (DM's discretion on which and the number of uses per day). The insidiousness is multiplied because the mirror's control is such that targets may not realize that they were influenced by a spell, especially if they were only instructed to do reasonable things. The mirror can even be used to disadvantage the charisma and wisdom saving throws of targets visible in it if needed. Other Suggestions: The Machiavellian Mirror's owner should be intelligent and paranoid, someone who takes all sorts of mundane and magical precautions to prevent the mirror from being visible and even having a reflection, especially when not in use.

She would lure them into the Crestwood, and once they were lost, send her pack of shadow hounds upon them. Once she completed the cloak, she gave it as a boon to a Rightous Paladin who wished to find the evil that was stealing kids. Many years would pass while possessing it, as he searched for the cause. When he learned the truth of his gift, he was driven mad with grief and self-loathing.

For example, casting a third level spell at ninth level takes 6 extra levels x 1/15 (7%) of average lifespan for the PC's race.

      "Bag of Luck - A seemingly ordinary leather bag with no markings or sinister aura whatsoever. It is secured by a thong long enough to go over a person's head, and will not open until someone places the thong around their neck. Inside the Bag of Luck are 24 pearlescent beads that smell delicious and seem almost to glow with their own light. Each bead is exactly one hour of luck, 12 good, 12 bad. There is no way to determine which is which without eating it and activating it. When under the effect of a good luck bead the user cannot fail in anything involving an element of luck. In game terms, every single die roll the user makes will be a critical success. When under the effects of a bad luck bead the user cannot succeed in anything involving an element of luck. In game terms every single die roll will be a critical failure. Any attempt to use logic or trickery to determine which beads are which by, for example taking one bead and seeing that it was bad luck and then eating all the remaining 23 on the theory that the good luck will counterbalance the bad luck, will backfire. In that example what the user took for bad luck initially will all turn out to have long term positive effects and taking all the remaining beads will result in catastrophe and possibly death from ill fortune. The bag cannot be taken from the user's neck until all beads are eaten. Any attempt to remove the bag before then will result in the bag tightening around the user's neck and strangling them until they stop trying to remove it. If the beads are not all used within 72 hours the bag will strangle and kill the user. Do you feel lucky?",
      "The Essay of Eris - A seemingly ordinary sheet of paper or parchment.

The contents may appear to be a personal letter from one person to another, a report from a rival agency, or whatever else would be most likely to cause the reader to think their friends or allies had betrayed them. There is no magic coercion; the reaction of the reader is entirely a matter of how paranoid they are. A normal person with no reason to think they have enemies it might dismiss its claims entirely. But if put into a delicate situation where betrayal is likely it can cause civil wars, bring down spy agencies, and turn a room of distrustful conspirators into a howling mob with each person seeking to kill all the others.",

It is now a Burning Skull of Sithrax and is continuously aflame about as hot as a normal fireplace fire. The Burning Skull of Sithrax will answer four questions 100% accurately, 100% honestly, and as unhelpfully as possible. When not answering questions the Burning Skull of Sithrax screams curses, threats, and describes in horrifying detail the tortures that Sithrax will inflict on all in earshot. After the fourth question is asked and answered the Burning Skull of Sithrax will consume itself and turn to ash after ten minutes of screaming the deepest and darkest secrets of the last person to ask it a question to anyone who can hear. Afterward the Eyespikes of Sithrax revert to their inert state and can be driven into the eyes of another victim.",
      "Siphon of Asmodeus - A gleaming silver chain about three feet long with a golden disk on one end and a copper disk on the other. It allows the person holding the golden disk to transfer injury, age, illness, tiredness, or any other negative condition to the person touching the copper disk. Any injury, regardless of severity or age, can be transferred. A person missing an arm could transfer that to the person on the copper end causing the victim to lose their arm while the person holding the gold disk regained their arm. Given a supply of victims a person with the Siphon of Asmodeus could theoretically live forever, in perpetual youth and perfect health. The most insidious aspect of the Siphon is that there are no downsides at all to the person benefiting. Their health is not creepy; their youth is not waxy. Using the Siphon is not painful to either the victim or the user, though obviously the victim may feel pain from whatever injuries or age are transferred to them. This, of course, encourages the owner to use it and by doing so spread misery and damn themselves.",
      "Demonbone Bow - The Demonbone Bow was crafted by the Church of Heavenly Light, a sect of fanatic demon hunting crusaders who believed that the ends justify the means and that demons deserved whatever fate they got. Made from bones and sinew extracted from a dozen living demons flayed and suspended from blessed chains while the Church did its grisly work. The bow is a weapon made specifically to kill demons, and it does the job quite well. Even when normal arrows are shot from the bow it does quadruple damage to demons, and when using arrows made from demon bone it will slay any common demon with a single hit, and do ten times normal damage even to demon lords. Those who use the bow become sadistic, careless ending of life in the name of their cause, and soon seek only the most brutal and agonizing means of achieving their goals. Whether this is due to the corrupting influence of the material from which the bow is made, or from the zealotry that went into its construction is an open question.",
      "The Tongue of Beelzebub - Appearing as a desiccated human tongue, if a sufficiently devoted (or deranged) person cuts out their own tongue and replaces it with the Tongue of Beelzebub the tongue will become living and work like a normal tongue. Once installed the Tongue of Beelzebub allows the user to lie perfectly. The user gains a large bonus to any skill related to lying, conning, deceit or any other illicit act involving speech. Lying becomes so natural, so second nature, to the user that within a week they must make an effort of will to tell the truth in any situation (in game terms, they need to pass a Will check that becomes increasingly difficult with each month of use). The user also gains an insatiable thirst for human blood, needing to drink the final drops of blood from the heart of a debauched liar, drunkard, or other sinful person every two weeks or they will begin to suffer effects identical to dying of thirst and will, in fact, die after two weeks and three days without blood. There is no way to get the necessary blood without killing a 'sinful' person. After one year of use, the person cannot speak the truth under any circumstances at all and loses the ability to discern reality from fantasy or truth from lies. They say whatever they think will benefit them the most in that moment with no regard at all for its truth or falsehood and those who hear them speak tend to believe them even if they contradict themselves. After two years of use the person tells lies to themselves, believing themselves to be the greatest, the best, the most amazing, and their ego grows to make them incapable of believing that anyone can do anything at all better than them. Most users die shortly after this, having convinced themselves that they can fly, or that they can defeat a giant in single combat, or other deadly tasks. The Tongue is currently held by a group of Beelzebub cultists who worship its user as the voice of Beelzebub on Earth and believe that the truth of the cosmos and other great things can be discerned from the lies if only one is clever enough to do so. Despite the fact that most who use the Tongue die after only two years there is always great competition among the devotees of Beelzebub to become its next bearer.",

In a week, they have turned inward, devoting their time to playing with it as a cat would a favored plaything, to the exclusion of all else. In a month, if a person tracks the totem to the last known location of the possessor, they will instead find two trinkets. The first day's effect can be broken by making a will save with disadvantage after one day, the first weeks effect with a will save and forced separation from the object for one week. Deactivating the totem by speaking the word is only effective until the end of the month the totem is given to the possessor.",

      "The Crown of the Woods: This antler headpiece (+1 AC) once belonged to an ancient wood-elf prince making all deer, caribou, elk, and moose species consider you friendly. Once per week you may call on one of these to ride, but if you harm your mount the horns constrict and pierce you for violating your pact with Nature.",
      "The Feywild Hatchet: Legendary prank gift to an old woodsman. Upon striking a tree it makes the tree grow taller and thicker, if used on an animal it heals them and makes them healthier. It wasn't completely useless as it can hew stone and iron like butter and the resulting debris has a 5% chance to turn into 10 lbs. of assorted gemstones.",
      "Dryad's Heart: Considered a blessing by the willing and a curse by the uninitiated this ornate amber, bone, wood, shell and jade beaded leather chest piece (+1 AC) transforms the wearer into a tree for 24 hours per day only recharging on the solstice. In the hands of a properly trained user of the Druidic language they can mark or tattoo their skin over time to lessen some of the more extreme effects. At low levels it gives the druid the ability to turn into a tree and back twice per day, leading to two charges of Barkskin per day while wearing it at level 5, and finally at level 10 it allows you to wildshape into a Treant. At level 16 your connection to Nature is so profound that you become the earthly anchor to your own NPC Dryad residing inside you that you may transfer to another tree should the need arise.",

      "Rat totem: A rat skull painted in red war paint. If used successfully it summons a swarm of shadowy rats with red glowing eyes that cannot be targeted by physical weapons and behave like a swarm type encounter.

      "The Crown of Moonlit Winters: A shimmering circlet made from enchanted ice and decorated with Druidic runes. The crown has a soft inner luminescence reminiscent of the night sky, making the wearer emit dim light in a 10-foot radius while they wear it. Attuning to the crown grants the wearer the ability to use the crown's properties, as well as immunity to cold damage as well as blindsight out to 60 feet. Both properties can only be used if the wearer is directly under the open night sky. Once per day, the wearer may use an action to use the crown's Herald of Winter property to change the weather in a 3-mile around the point they activate this property to some sort of snowy weather of the wearer's choosing. This weather can range anywhere from a gentle snowfall to a moderately strong blizzard, and requires 1d4 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. The weather lasts for 8 hours, and requires no concentration to maintain. In addition, three times per day, the wearer may use an action to use the crown's Freezing Light property. The wearer may conjure a brilliant moonbeam from the sky, filled with fast-moving freezing mist, forcing all creatures in its 10 foot radius between the ground and the sky to make a Constitution saving throw against the wearer's spell save DC. A creature takes 3d10 cold damage and 3d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Any creature that fails the saving throw is also blinded and has their movement speed reduced to 0 for the next minute as their eyes are burned and their feet are frozen.

      "Falling Leaf: A mottled copper scimitar that is colored in the shades of autumn. Etchings of various leaves cover the flat of the blade and sway gently as though exposed to an invisible wind. The scimitar is a +2 magical weapon innately, with an additional property that can be activated if the wielder attunes to the blade. Once per day, the wielder may use an action to use the blade's Shroud of Autumn property if they are attuned to the scimitar. The wielder calls forth a swirling cyclone of leaves around themselves in a 5-foot radius for up to a minute. While the cyclone is active, all ranged attacks made against the wielder have disadvantage. If the property is used while within an area with moderate density foliage, the cyclone instead has a 10-foot radius and causes all melee attacks to be made with disadvantage as well. The wielder also gains the ability to use their reaction to cause a ranged attack passing through the cyclone to automatically miss its target. The wielder may stop the cyclone and have the leaves drift away using a bonus action on their turn. If the property is used while within an area with high-density foliage, the cyclone gains new benefits in addition to the previous improvements. The cyclone instead has a 15-foot radius, which is considered difficult terrain while the cyclone is active, and all ranged attacks not made by the wielder automatically miss if they enter the cyclone. One time while the cyclone is active, the wielder can form blade replicas from the swirling leaves to attack a multitude of foes. By doing so, the wielder uses an action to make a single melee weapon attack with the scimitar against any number of creatures inside the cyclone, with a separate attack roll for each target.",
      "Coral Marstaff: A reef-like quarterstaff that is covered in suspended globules of water which act as portals to the nearest body of water.

      "Primal Crystals of Akaroth: Each crystal representing the four elements adds 1d4 damage of that type to your attacks. Your animal wildshapes are now made out of those elements (fire, water, earth, air) should you choose.",
      "Moon Sickle of Cressk: Using this platinum, silver, and gold weapon to harvest mistletoe under light of the full moon lets you make a Druid Grove permanent in only half the time (6 months in-game). If you happen to find a suitable stump you can leave this weapon and the requisite material components in a forcecage within the Druid Grove and in one year it will have been made permanent by trapping a small part of you in a time loop just long enough to complete the ritual. Occasionally it has been known to fail and release a druid from the time loop should they die elsewhere.",
      "Mask of the Crystal Sea: an egg shaped mask cut from an angular, opalescent crystal. The wearer of this mask not only gains +3 to perception checks to spot fey creatures but also receives fey as a bonus language.

At the start of the player's next turn, a pack of 2d4 spectral wolves coalesce into being near them and begin to hound the marked creature.

If a spectral wolf dies, it dissipates into the air for 24 hours, after which it reassembles itself within 100 feet of the target and continues its hunt.

The only curiosity is a sad old man with a gnarled crown sitting upon a small bench, not quite in the foreground though impossible to ignore.

The cave, though dimly lit, is actually very homey. The walls are lined with over full, wooden bookcases, stacks of books line a narrow path to a comfortable chair. The youth explains that hundreds of years ago, they grew tired of being accused of vampirism just because they are immortal (they are very dismissive of the fact that they are immortal and don?t seem to know the source of their immortality themselves). They decided to gather as many books as they could, use the money they had put aside to construct this secret room and buy a comfortable coffin, then fake their death. Hundreds of years later they definitely don?t regret their decision, only pausing briefly before offering the party a quest for more books to fully restock the youth?s ?library?, along with whatever reward is offered, the party gets all of the old books to do with as they please, as well as a small volume of surprisingly well written fanfiction.",

Digging further down towards the rest of the coffin, you find a huge, hunched, mishapen skeleton. It appears, though twisted, to be posed as if it had been the one lain to rest in the coffin. Other uncovered parts of the coffin appear to be normal humanoid sized; coinpurse, tatters of clothing, even what remains of a pair of shoes near the huge skeleton?s feet are medium sized. Some jewelry lies broken among the bones, a necklace emanating fading transmutation magic near the skeleton?s neck with its chain snapped and two rings split from the inside laying upon the finger bones.

After almost a full minute of this, the youth can no longer move any of its body except for its eyes and what remains of its face.

This miniature doll house, in turn, is a perfect duplicate in its own right - complete with smaller dolls examining an even smaller house. If the investigation continues beyond a certain point (most likely requiring the use of some variety of magic), it will be shown that the iterative pattern begins to break down - things begin to be subtly altered with each subsequent doll house the PCs reveal.

Arranged on five pedestals around the sarcophagus are the canopic jars in which the mummy's vital organs were placed.

      "The neverburning torch. A jet black torch, with an inscription in gold upon its side: \"Only in your hour of darkest need will I light.\" All attempts - magical or otherwise - to light the torch will fail, but if the character carrying the torch ever finds himself upon the brink of death, the neverburning torch will flare to life.",
      "In the face of a mountain, an ancient stone stairway has been cut.

      "Feydust: A soft white powder that, in the right light, shines with soft blues and red. The powder tastes like burnt ozone, which makes it evident that it needs to be snorted. Use causes bonuses to IQ based tasks but also makes its user seek it out more and more for increasingly trivial tasks.",
      "Halfling Weed: Most often dried, chopped, and smoked. Causes extreme emotions to abate and induces near euphoric mellow-ness and, occasionally, a user will experience mild hallucinations. Side-effects include increased appetite and red, puffy eyes.",
      "Blue sand: A substance similar to fine sand found at the beach, only that its deep blue colored. Consumed through the nose. One to five doses (depending on Wis or Con modififer) are enough to develop an addiction. Early effects (one to three weeks): Enhanced perception, athletics & acrobatics Following deterioration of body and mind: First (after four weeks of constant consumption): One exhaustion stack per three days without a dose. Second (after six weeks): Negative modifiers (-2) on all attributes and disadvantage on all skills. Third (after 8 weeks): Death.",
      "Dream Flake: Thin slivers of a dried, black fungus. When place between cheek and gum, it induces hallucinations and euphoria. When smoked, the user enters an extremely vivid waking dream which can last for hours. Extended use blackens the teeth and make \"bad trips\" more common. Addictive.",
      "Wrymwood - looks like a cinnamon stick but smells of fungus. Grind some up and put in a tea. When drunk, it provides a psychedelic trip for 1d4 hours (halved on a DC 15 con ST and doubled when failing by more than 5).",
      "Grellsvice: A drug usually administered as an oral capsule made from the spikes at the end of a grell's tentacles. Effects last for roughly two hours on a regular 200 mg dose, and leave the user with a four hour hangover of sorts. The main draw to grellsvice is a tingling sense in the muscles and extra-sensitive motor functionality. This comes with a strong euphoric rush whenever a new body part is moved. The drawback is the lack of motor functionality during the hangover and the incredibly dulled sense of touch accompanied with it.",
      "Sundrop: a bright yellow/orange liquid, naturally incandescent, as if it was a liquified ray of sunshine (henceforth the name). Originally used as a magically synthesized antidepressant, Sundrop when consumed tricks the user into believing that they are happy, as it quite literally gives them 'warm feelings'. Overusage may leave the user feeling withered between uses, as their dependency has rendered them unable to produce dopamine and serotonin. Over time users also commonly begin to build tolerances to Sundrop, requiring greater quantities to be consumed to maintain the effect. Overdosing on Sundrop causes feverish conditions, as the drug radiates through the users veins, ultimately burning them alive from the inside out.",
      "Patch: It works similarly to ecstasy, expanding yourself to feel the sensations all around you. It grants the ability to speak with plants and animals for 1d4+1 hours, and the comedown has a DC15 CON save. Failing the save adds one point of exhaustion immediately after waking from the first long rest you take, and lasts until completing the next long rest.",
      "Lakua: ground silverly bark from a type of tree only found deep in swamps. Low dosages are generally taken orally. Heavier users often make a paste to apply to their gums. Addicts may smear it into cuts. It gives an adrenaline rush and time seems to slow down but the duration of the high is short. Death comes from heart failure or self neglect. Psychologically addictive not physically.",
      "Zooterran: Made from refined Exem plums. Alters one's sense of direction and causes one to only turn right when faced with a left/right choice.",
      "Blackroot: This lichen grows on large rocks and boulders found above timberline (the elevation at which trees do not have enough oxygen to grow). When chewed on, it causes the user to have a pleasant, tingling sensation of the lips, tongue, and gums. As well, it can give the user a sense of mental sharpness and alertness. If swallowed, it causes nausea and vomiting if the user fails a DC 13 Constitution check. If used for 1d6 hours continuously, the user must make a DC 15 Constitution check. If failed, they experience nausea, but if passed they gain advantage on Perception checks for the next 1d4 hours. Not inherently addictive, though if used for 1d12 days in a row, the user will feel extremely groggy if they do not use it every morning.",
      "Deluge: Packaged in single-dose vials, ingesting this ethereal blue liquid gives subjects temporary access to spell-like abilities of varying degrees; usually cantrips and 1st Level spells, but sometimes more powerful spells depending on the purity of the substance. However, the temporary magic abilities come with a price: each time an individual ingests Deluge they take Constitution damage: 1d4 for average doses, 1d6 and above for purer doses. This is because the magical energy that Deluge is providing is actually taken from their own souls and continued use will cause them to gradually wither away. It's named Deluge because it feels like a flood of energy and power washes over you.",
      "Barb: A thorny stalk from the Cheb barb weed (looks like purple buck thorn). Sold by the branch, you can pull off individual thorns and use them to scrape or pierce the skin. The side effects are similar to pot, but to much can result in paralysis.",
      "Scurva: a vial filled with an irridesant liquid. When drunk it causes it user to see colors more vibrantly and lights to shimmer and become more liquid like. Also makes its user compleatly intoxicated.",

      "Cyclops Tear: Taken by eating the powder. Causes your eyes to water a ludicrous amount. The tears produced are the main attraction of this drug. They taste perfect and are guaranteed to be the best thing you have and ever will taste, but the taste varies by the person. It also only tastes that way to the person who's tears it actually is. To everyone else it tastes like tears. Overdose causes one of your eyes to desiccate and fall out. Oddly enough, people with only one eye anyway are immune to this effect, so it is very popular among cyclopes.",
      "Goji Leaves: Originally created as a weapon of war, Goji Leaves (when taken in just about any form) give you resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, advantage on all strength checks and saving throws, and rage damage equal to a barbarian of your level.

When the thick, reddish-brown liquid is injested (via mouth), the user is hit by intense pain, making them unable to move for 2 rounds, having disadvantage on all ability checks for 1d6+1 minutes. During this time, target will likely give up any info. After the pain, user feels intense pleasure for 1d4 hours, although this is less an effect of Agony and more of them appreciating their lack of pain.",
      "Yggdrasil Sap: A legendary drug that causes you to see into your future. This future is usually the users own death if they don't pass the DC 15 Constitution saving throw to not die from it.",
      "Weirdling Tea: a tea that shifts in color from orange to blue, when drank the user sees the effect of a roll on the wild magic table. (This is however just a hallucination)",
      "Tasha's: a powdered form of Tasha's Hideous Laughter, looks like a great time, but really really isn't.",
      "Powdered Power: a glittering substance that almost looks like diamond dust, consumed by snorting. It fills you with a sense of euphoria and you feel like you can do anything, for about an hour. During this time you have advantage on all ability checks and attack rolls. After the hour is up, you must make a DC 5 CON save against addiction, and the DC increases by 5 after every dose. Should you fail this save, you then have disadvantage on all ability checks, saving throws and attack rolls until your next dose. Once addicted you no longer have to make CON saves after each dose. To remove the addiction you can make a DC 20 CON save after going one month without taking a dose.",
      "Brighteye Venom: This venom has, so far, only been consumable by having the Brighteye Spider inject the user. The bite leaves small, purplish holes and blue lines run up the veins. The user's eyes will turn purple and blue, as if the cosmos were trapped within them. A creature injected with Brighteye Venom must pass a DC 16 Constitution save. Failure results in the creature being stunned for 1d4 hours and poisoned for 1d4 days. Passing the save allows the creature to cast the scrying spell, with a spell save DC for the target of 20.",
      "Top hat: a small top hat shaped consumable that melts on your tongue, soon enough you begin to see statistics on item weight, size, price, juice content, fuzzability, gloppiness...and perhaps some or all of these are just made up in you mind.",
      "Druidic Dream: A mostly benign pill made by druids and sold to whoever wishes to buy some. Its ingredients and manufacture are secrets the druids keep to themselves. When held under the tongue the pill puts the user in a mild state of giddyness similar to being a \"happy drunk\" for 1d4 hours (DC13 con save for half, 19 to deny), followed by 1d4 hours of sleep with idyllic dreams. Addiction 1, 10%, nature.",
      "Elendran Pipeweed: Algae that were considered a pest by the elendran merfolk, until some crazy surfacer decided to set it on fire and noticed his mind was both sharper and duller at the same time.

Addiction 1, 5%, nature.",
      "Feywillow Fruit: Fruit from a tree in the Feywild. The more the user eats, the more they want to eat. It is not harmful in and of itself, just highly addictive. Heavy users are eventually drawn into the Feywild, leaving their friends and families behind, often without saying a word. Addiction 2, nature.",
      "Funpowder: A magic/alchemic powder made by reclusive druids, funpowder changes the user's biologic gender for 1 hour for every ounce consumed. Usually consumed while diluted in water and/or in combination with a spiked drink.",
      "Mountain Lotus Extract: A rare but enormous mountain lotus is put in a cauldron filled with alcohol and sugar. The cauldron is then heated until the flower dissolves, then left in the fire until most of the alcohol evaporates and a black sludge is left. The sludge is then mixed with Chemis sawdust, at which point it can be either eaten (either by itself or as a spice) or smoked. When used the Extract greatly expands the user's mind, granting +6 to intelligence, wisdom and charisma for an hour. Once the effect wears off the user must make a DC30 intelligence saving throw or \"gain\" a permanent -1 to intelligence, wisdom and charisma, as their brain has overexerted itself. This effect can only be removed by a Wish spell.",

      "The Flayed Mind: A drink containing some of the Mind Flayer's mind-numbing powers. Makes the user dumb and slow, much like weed however much much stronger. Any mental saving throws made while under its effect automatically fail, making this the preferred tool of enslavers everywhere. Once the effect wears off the user may make a DC20 int save to remember what happened while under the Flayed Mind's effects. This saving throw can only be made once. Addiction 1, psionic.",
      "The Ladies' Love: Succubus sweat has pheromones meant to make men go crazy in bed. Some alchemists can potentialize this effect, making it stronger and longer-lasting.

When drunk in small amounts it merely causes euphoria and hallucinations for 2d6 hours (DC20 con save for half), without putting your mind in direct contact with eldritch horrors or bursting the heart.",
      "Angel's Trumpet: A plant with immeasurable potency. When the plant is burned and inhaled, you see dead relatives, friends, or others that died nearby and converse with them casually without being phased by their presence.

During this time the drinker gains a +5 to melee attack and damage rolls, advantage on Constitution saves, and advantage on saves against being charmed and frightened. However, once the time is up the drinker must succeed a DC 15 Constitution Saving Throw or gain a level of exhaustion. If the save fails by 5 or more, the drinker gains 2 levels. (The advantage on CON saves can't help on this save because the effect is already over)",

Gorgon gives the user paralysis for a couple of hours and gives vivid hallucinations, which are somewhat controlled by the user like a lucid dream. Most of the time the experience is pleasant but people have been known to have some horrible trips. Most people will prepare before taking the drug and lie in bed or in a grassy field, but those with more desperate addictions can often been found collapsed in the streets, stone still except for rapid eye movement.",
      "Dreamer's Fancy: A dark, shimmering liquid extracted from a rare root. When imbibed, renders the drinker unconscious as it plunges their mind into a black void in which they have full control to shape and create whatever they wish. Those who drink from the same root can participate in this lucid dream together, and their creation can be returned to by drinking from this root again.",
      "Flash powder: A vial containing pink vapors and dust. Upon lifting the vial to the characters nose and inhaling deeply, the user will be filled with an immense sense of power and will now be able to run, jump, swim, and lift up to 4 times as much as they previously could for 1 hour. In combat they may take an additional action once per battle. After 1 hour of usage, the user will feel sluggish and will have their senses dulled which will result in a disadvantage on perception and most strength based abilities for 4 hours or until completing a short rest. Each usage of flash powder will get weaker (-1 on the multiplier) for every time you inhale it without taking 2 weeks to recover from your body becoming immune to flash powder.",
      "Limit Remover: A highly expensive pill that after 2 hours of ingesting grants the user the ability to cast any number of spells without restrictions for 10 minutes according to the shady vendor. In actuality it is just a mint, a coat button, or something pull shaped that gives no benefit whatsoever.",
      "Faerie Food: There is a longstanding piece of wisdom which says that you should never eat food offered to you by a faerie. This is absolutely true; in the feywild, magic is so commonplace that \"cooking\" is considered it's own school of magic, a mix of enchantment and illusion. Such food when eaten provides a taste that is far beyond anything a real tastebud could ever feel, and addiction is fast, difficult to resist and often lethal as mere mortal foods are not even considered food to an addict. Addiction is generally permanent, but can be cured slowly by a specialist who slowly drops the quality of food an addict ears until they can handle mortal foods again. Alternatively, if the food was eaten only once, a well placed Modify Memory spell may cure the mental dependence.",
      "Faerie Dust: A very fine, iridescent powder which is kept in a wax sealed bottle, it is consumed by unsealing the bottle and very gently wafting the contents towards the nose with a DC 10 dexterity check, with failure resulting in an overdose. When correctly dosed, instills a gentle euphoria as senses sharpen and surroundings appear more vibrant, providing advantage on investigation and perception checks for one minute. When overdosed, the user experiences sensory overload, becoming confused for one minute. Faerie Dust, despite the generic name, is actually the collected breath of a faerie dragon. They find it hilarious that mortals can get high off their breath, and will happily provide the breath attack itself with only gentle coaxing. Some faerie dragons make their home in drug dens, exchanging their breath for a luxurious lifestyle and the opportunity to ply their pranks upon the many citizens of a mortal city. Some particularly daring patrons will pay handsomely for a high \"straight from the source\", taking the breath attack of the faerie dragon head on and inhaling deeply. The high provided is incredibly intense, and as a result such services are usually only offered with the recipient strapped down on a specially constructed bench.",
      "Shatter: A waxy, pale amber substance that can be smoked or consumed in a tincture. In lower doses it produces a pleasant high, but in higher doses (and for particularly sensitive individuals) it can cause a person to literally split in into multiple versions of themselves. If a PC consumes shatter and fails a saving throw, they are split into several nearly indistinguishable copies of themselves. A roll of 2 + 1d6 gives the number of shards. Okay, now for the catch: the character's stats must be distributed among the shards with no duplication, so the sum of the shards' abilities is the same as the original character. Additionally, all of the shards have an aspect or condition representing their intoxicated state. After a period of time at GM's discretion, the shards will coalesce and merge again into the original character.",
      "Venge: a deep red powder of mineral origin that can be snorted for a euphoric and stimulant effect. If the character consuming it has any Berserker or Jekyll/Hyde like attributes, their Dark Side will come out 2-3 hours after ingestion, or if provoked. Even characters lacking such a vulnerability, become belligerant and disagreeable after doing a line of Venge.",
      "Mummy Powder: though its true origin is unknown, the one thing that's certain is that it doesn't come from a mummy. When a sufficient quantity is consumed mixed with wine, it puts the drinker into a catatonic state for several hours. They experience a sensation of being transported elsewhere, into a vast unlit space. Cold cylcopean stones tile the floor and neither walls nor ceiling can be found. Many experience a presence, a monstrous and unspeakably ancient intellect with only one desire: escape from the dusty emptiness of this prison and into the fullness of the waking world. This being can and will barter various intangible goods: knowledge, memories, skills. However, it only has access to such things as it could previously have acquired from another mummy powder user. Furthermore, it will not give any knowledge directly pertaining to its own nature or the nature of mummy powder. Finally, before making such a transaction, characters are filled with a sense of dread and the knowledge that the being would only have carried out such a bargain if it brought the day of its escape nearer. This can be represented by a will save if the GM wants to emphasize the direness of the act.",
      "Forget Me Nots: These flowers grow in the wild, yellow in color. They can commonly be found in bright sunny climates. When consumed they apply a temporary new life. When consumed you believe you have a different life.

      "Fever Fire - Made from the petals of a translucent flower that grows even in the coldest and most barren environments.

      "Slate Fever '- An uncommon sickness that causes skin to become hard and brittle. Originating from the underdark and eventually making its way to the surface, Slate Fever propagates through contact with mosses and fungi contaminated with the disease, as well as through contact with the affected skin of those with the sickness. Early symptoms include a slight grey discoloration of skin tone, uncomfortable stiffness, and unusual amounts of neck and back cracking when moving. The symptoms eventually progress to the point where the diseased becomes noticeably grey and stiff, causing them to move in small, jerk-like motions and have their speed reduced by half. In addition, the diseased develops exceptionally brittle skin that cracks easily and painfully. This gives them vulnerability to bludgeoning damage and causes them to frequently make Constitution saving throws to avoid taking 1d4 damage from shattering parts of their skin with excessive contact. The disease itself usually passes by itself over the course of one week resting and recuperating, but can be cured within 2 days if the diseased is properly treated with a combination of various tree saps. Catching this disease once results in the diseased being more vulnerable to it in the future.",

For example, for one round they may be a horde of smaller, weaker creatures, and on the next round they may fuse together to become a larger and stronger creature. The DM has a number of stat blocks prepared for creatures this boss can form, each of which has a minimum HP requirement to form. To make things more interesting, there may be stores of additional mass hidden around the battlefield, which the boss will attempt to reach to regenerate hit points and mass.

An intelligent and greedy sonofabitch, Kiirn sinks ships for their cargo which he then takes to his nest in a cove on a nearby island. The first stage of the fight takes place in the sea with players on a ship, which Kiirn is attempting to sink. The captain of the ship deems la d the only safe haven and heads for the nearest landmass, Kiirn's island. Along the way Kiirn may become damaged enough to retreat, but the Captain insists on landing and repairing the damage. Otherwise, the ship becomes damaged enough and sets off on a crash course for the beach. The second stage of the fight is a scramble up the beach as an angered Kiirn attempts to kill the party and sailors. Players may stand and fight, attempt to rescue the sailors or flee. Kiirn is less concerned with the cargo than the people at this point. The third stage follows the retreat up the beach, a chase through the rainforest on the island. The players may chase Kiirn to finish him off as he leads them to his cove, or Kiirn may chase the players, angered by their defiance and the damage they've done, or perhaps angered that they escaped him at the beach. The fourth stage is a fight in a large cave that leads to the cove. This is the point at which players and Kiirn alike are likely be exhausted and close to death. FINISH HIM. At each stage, Kiirn has a different objective which can vary based on the player's actions. You can also spice it up with Kiirn having something akin to lair actions in each of the stages as well as environmental opportunities.",

At the start of each turn, \"zone of irresistible dance\" is cast through speakers that line the walls, which the Necro-dancer has the remote to. Each turn, the Necro dancer summons 'backup dancer' skeletons, or something that would be comparatively weak for the party's level. This goes on until the song ends, at which point a giant disco ball is dropped from the ceiling with the intent to crush the players, taking advantage of the disadvantage dex throws and lowered movement. After that, the dancers stop being summoned, the zone of irresistible dance does not get cast again, and the Necro-dancer is left all alone. The song could also stop by breaking the speakers or remote, or escaping the dance floor.",

      "A towering, ominous obelisk made of steel is guarded by 3-6 Animated Armors, 3-6 Flying Swords, and 1-3 Helmed Horrors. The obelisk is covered in glowing arcane sigils and scribbles that shine brighter when the player's step forward to confront it, at which point the assorted defenders move to attack. The obelisk manifests a eye-like sigil which moves around its surface each turn to channel a beam that repairs and reanimates fallen defenders. This beam causes the target to regain 3d8 hit points as the components are magically regrown and imbued once more with magical energy, and is fired one time on each of the obelisk's turns. Any destroyed constructs hit with the beam come back to life at 0 hit points and regain the amount rolled for the beam, though they cannot take their turn until the following round. To beat the obelisk boss, the invaders may attempt to attack a construct targeted by the eye beam while the ray is being channeled, which causes the amount of damage dealt to it to also go through to the arcane entity within the obelisk. The boss also takes 10 damage every time one of the arcane sigils or a significant part of a particular scribble is erased or damaged in some way, whether the marks are gashed deeply with a blade or blotted out with a destructive spell. The arcane entity within the obelisk has a total of 80 hit points, while the obelisk and the magical markings on it have an AC of 15. Destroying the obelisk entity makes it dissipate into the surrounding area without a trace, causing the arcane markings to go dark and all the constructs to fall apart, thereby ending the boss fight.",
      "Some amorphous creature that is under the permanent effect of a mirror image spell that refreshes after all images are dispersed (which could be flavored as overlapping images of the same figure, or many different figures, like nightmares, occupying the same space).

It has an obscene amount of health and CON and cannot take damage from an attack that does less than 10 damage.

      "Chulepa Peek: This self-abasing horse is covered in mud and feces. It will not eat unless you kick it (believing itself to be unworth feeding) and will sleep in the rain instead of a warm stable (believing itself unworthy of such a luxury).",
      "Golden God Farmer: This golden-haired horse is cursed. It cannot stop running. It will always move as fast as the fastest horse, unless it is racing away/towards another fast-moving object. In that case, it will be slightly faster. If it stops running, it dies.",
      "No-Bath: This roan mare is also cursed. Whenever it meets a new person it looks at them and says, \"You must help me! I've been transformed into a horse by an evil wizard, and cursed to only be able to speak once, after which I will forget my human past. You must kill my owner to free me! You are my only hope!\" (All of this is a lie, of course.)",
      "Scabby Joe: Infested with lice. Possibly their deity. Their itchy, itchy deity.",
      "Zooltharno the Gelid: This horse is ice-cold. It moves slowly, but can levitate up or down at the rate of 1 foot per second. When levitating, it cannot move horizontally unless it is pushed/pulled.",
      "Ifrit: This is a gaseous horse. It lives in a bottle. When the bottle is open, it becomes a flying, purple steed. If it ever takes any damage, or gets wet, it dies.",
      "Shaggadoom the Questant: After an expedition to uncharted dimensions, this bug-eyed horse was the only survivor. It is paralyzed, and its face is perpetually frozen in an expression of raw horror. Anyone who falls asleep near the horse will wake up beside the horse, transported safely across as much territory a healthy horse could cover in the amount of time that they'd been asleep.",
      "Griplatch the Klorohund: This greenish equoid is meant to be edible. Each day, a reddish, pulpy fruit buds off from its face, providing an extra ration. It doesn't eat, but instead gains its nourishment by chewing your food (in its dead-end mouth), sucking all the flavour out, and then depositing the pulp back in your hands. Very friendly.",
      "Thorsor Greybreed: This horse is not a horse, but a demon wearing a horse's skin. Exceptionally fast and vicious. Each day there is a 1-in-20 chance that the demon will be recalled to hell, leaving an empty horse skin behind. It will return the next day and behave as if nothing strange has happened.",
      "Tillamook Flenge: This is a reverse vampire horse. It suffers from an overabundance of blood, and must be bled daily. If it is not, it will begin to get desperate, like a cow that hasn't been milked, and will extrude it's glossal syringe in order to inject it's heavily parasitized blood into the nearest mammal.",
      "Hammerfaust the Invincible: This small, grey horse doesn't look very special. However, it is completely immune to damage, except for damage from stupid weapons. Stupid weapons (nunchucks, a polehammer, a glaive-guisarme, a throwing chakram, etc) the attack becomes a critical hit.",
      "The Horse of a Different Color: This is a fairy horse. Every day, this horse changes into a different horse, always mundane except for this strange fact. If you leave saddlebags on overnight, they will disappear. 5% chance that it appears with someone's saddlebags in the morning, with something interesting inside. (It is possible for other things to travel with the horse. Once it was found with a corpse on its back, tied to the saddle.)",
      "Double John: This horse is a horse at both ends. Capable of running backwards as fast as forwards. The two horse heads are known as \"Eaty John\" and \"Shitty John\".",
      "The Invisible Horse: Is truly invisible, but flatulence ruins any invisibility attempts 33% of the time.",
      "Miriam Waggish: This mare is a were-human. Every full moon she spends three days as a human. She formerly worked as a launderer in town.",
      "Stinger: Has a wooden leg with a wasp nest built into it. The wasps automatically attack anyone who attacks Stinger, but will generally leave anyone else alone.",
      "The Metaphorical Horse: This is a book, not a horse. It is about a metaphorical horse named Life that carries us through good times and bad times, with a clumsy, powerful gait. Anyone who reads it aloud is able to run at the speed of a horse, but only over territory that a horse could normally run over. They lose 1d6 Wisdom after this exertion.",
      "Fiercer: This is a coal-black horse with a spiked iron collar. Attacks as a sixth-level fighter. Displays murderous impulses towards gnomes and things about the size of gnomes. Is wanted for genocide, as it has exterminated two gnomish villages (over 150 gnomes have met their doom at the end of his shiny, shiny hooves.) Is being hunted by Masdrana, the unicorn bounty-hunter, who intends to hang him.",
      "Trismegistus: Shaved and tattooed with arcane symbols. Each of his flanks contains one spell. His back contains a fully functioning demonic summoning circle, which is capable of containing a demon, but will not prevent it from riding Trismegistus. This horse has a terrible phobia of candles.",
      "Lovely Lucy: An attractive roan mare. She is the wife of Brogtharion, a barbarian from a tribe with a long history of very literal horse husbandry. Brogtharion will come along (he is part of whatever deal gave you Lovely Lucy), but will not ride her nor speak to her, as they are currently having a marital dispute.",
      "Gobby Nobbler: Lumpy looking horse with a dull hide. Knees actually bend the wrong way. Close inspection will reveal that it is actually some sort of giant insect wearing a horse's skin. Very affectionate and loyal. Terrified of actual horses.",
      "The Smaragdine Mare: This horse is green, and perpetually pregnant. If fed something, will excrete a variation of it. Milk turns into wine. Apples turn into pears. Potions turn into a different kind of potion. Gems turn into other types of gems (but these require some coaxing to eat). If she ever eats the flesh of another creature, she will birth a monstrous version of that creature and die in the process. The seller of this horse will usually add the instruction \"Don't feed her flesh.\" but will not know the actual reason.",
      "Mount Vlatingor: This is either a enormous man or a small giant. Either way, he is educated, well-spoken, and completely insane. He believes that he is a horse, and will become extremely angry if he is not treated like one. After progressing through argumentation and threats of abandonment, he will leave. Passengers are carried on his shoulders.",
      "Motley Samson: Adorned in a jester's motley. Aging, grey-haired, and sway-backed. Will perform a humorous little dance for as long as a tambourine is played (sold with the horse). Also trained to detect the most common edible poisons.",
      "Sir Tomborious: Barrel-chested Clydesdale with an enormous claymore strapped to his side.. Acts like a normal horse, albeit more loyal than most. If he witnesses a damsel in distress, he stands up, removes his hooves (they are just painted, steel caps) to reveal his hands, draws his claymore, and wades into battle. After the situation has been resolved, he sheathes his sword, puts his hoof caps back on, and returns to normal.",
      "Svalbard: This horse turns into a small viking longboat (25 feet long) when wet. In this form, it has a painted horse figurehead. When it is dry, it turns back into a horse. A splash from a puddle is insufficient to provoke the transformation, but rain will do it.",
      "Madera: Whenever startled or scared, becomes as rigid as a wooden statue and falls over, unless she was standing still. (Not actually wooden, just paralyzed, like those fainting goat videos.) Fails all saves vs. fear. Half-price.",
      "Francifal Saint Montaigne: Makes owlbear noises. Does not fear high places since it thinks it can fly. It cannot.",
      "Joreppo La Bomba: An audible ticking can be heard from the horse at all times. If this horse dies from an impactful death (non-poison, non-level drain) it explodes as a 5d6 fireball. It is being sold by Joreppo Morone, an extremely nervous man who screams when startled.",
      "Hammerhead: A normal-seeming horse gifted with an abnormally hard head. Instead of stamping on enemies, it bludgeons them with its head.",
      "Maggot: Exhales blue smoke. Vibrates. Moves jerkily. Doesn't need to eat. Turns into a miniature black hole (as sphere of annihilation) upon death, a state that lasts for 1 minute.",
      "Ekinna: Lays a chicken-sized egg each night. If the egg is not destroyed, it will hatch into a horse-headed monstrosity that will seek to devour the marrow from whoever Ekinna loves the most (usually her owner). If Ekinna doesn't eat the slain monstrosity by each morning, she will sicken. If she misses two of these meals consecutively, she dies.",
      "Solaris: Supposedly a horse from the sun-god's own chariot. Golden orange coat, almost luminous. Runs at 3x horse speed, but only in a westerly or partially-westerly direction. Must be towed east if you want to go in that direction. Immune to fire damage.",
      "Rabban Lamadre: Very somber horse possessing a glorious mustache. As long as its rider is honorable and motivated, Rabban will appear in their dreams to offer platitudes and advice. When its rider dies, Rabban will appear to them, offering its body. If the person accepts, they return the day, sharing Rabban's body.",
      "Montresor: Staggers around as if it were drunk, falling over at least once ever hour. Only sobers up when drunk (which only requires about 20 drinks). When sober, is an exceptionally quick and attentive steed.",
      "Bitey the Unicorn: Appears to be a unicorn with its horn sawed off, deprived of all its powers except for the ability to know the entire sexual history of anyone it looks at. Makes for a passable horse, except it will only allow riders who are virgins. Bites sluts remorselessly. (A slut, in this context, is anyone who enjoys sex too much or has had sex too recently.)",
      "Benisequash: An Enchanted Dwarven Pony. Under the saddle there is a keyhole. If unlocked (by using the key provided), the entire back of the horse will open to reveal an wood-walled space, the same dimensions as a large chest. This doesn't seem to affect the horse's biology. At the bottom of the chest is the horse's living heart, still pumping blood.",
      "Iron Head: Head permanently locked inside a metal spike-helmet. Trained to batter down doors. Will knock down the average door after 1d6 bashes. Will knock itself out after 1d4+2 attempts (unless the door is open by then). Afraid of goblins.",
      "Moonbeam: No legs. Levitates. Mechanically identical to a normal horse, except no kick or trample attacks. Eats half as much.",
      "Lucifer: This red-skinned horse smells of brimstone. Instead of a tail, it has a long handle extending from its ass. If this handle is grasped firmly and pulled, the horse will turn inside out and a morningstar will be pulled from the horse's ass. (You are basically turning the horse into a weapon.) It is a morningstar (d6) enhanced against goblins, farmers, and clergy.",
      "The King of Horses: Must be treated with the utmost deference and respect. All other horses will bow to the King of Horses upon meeting him, and at no point will any horse act against the King of Horses, even refusing to charge against an army that fields him. Will only allow himself to be ridden by royalty, but has a hard time figuring this out with his horsey brain. Functionally--anyone in fancy clothes who wears a crown and smells nice will do.",
      "Imbri: This coal-black horse sleeps all day, catatonically. During the night, she can run at 10x speed overland by jumping through people's dreams (but only over land where dreaming people are--she's mostly useless in a desert). If the rider is abandoned by Imbri while in a dream, they are stranded there.",
      "Jigello: This simpering, idiotic horse has only 1 HP. If it takes damage or suffers a sudden impact, it deflates. It can be revived with 1 minute with a patch kit (or glue) and 10 minutes of blowing air into its mouth. Extremely bouyant. Loves sweets.",
      "Guzza: This horse is always wet, and bits of him are always dropping off. Can squeeze through openings as small as 1 inch in diameter. Only eats roots, tubers, and animal skin. Licks fingers to show affection.",
      "Richelieu: This horse constantly emits a low glow, as bright as a torch. Rapidly ages, and will die in a week unless it spends a day buried underground, which regenerates its youth.",
      "Traverlane: Does not whinny, but instead sings like a bird. If stabbed, songbirds exit the wound. If kissed, any curses on the kisser are transferred instead to Traverlane. All of this is disclosed by the salesman. Currently cursed to die in a fire, so fire attacks are Enhanced against it (This last fact is not disclosed.)",
      "Milchie: Impossibly flatulent. Makes it impossible to surprise things. If hugged around the midsection and squeezed, will produce an stinking cloud, which causes all breathing things in 50' to begin retching and vomiting for 1 minute. Milchie is not immune to this effect.",
      "Scamperella the Dancing Horse: Knows 55 different dances and can teach them to you, if you request them by name. Includes the forbidden dance known as \"The Black Mamba\" which drives onlookers insane. Can also be commanded to dance as it walks away, which exerts a pied piper-like effect on nearby children (or any juvenile animal).",
      "Rufus Damascus: Smokes a pipe. Trained to notice clues and solve mysteries. If the party misses a clue, Rufus has a 5-in-6 chance to notice it, and then point it out by rolling his eyes and flicking his tail in the appropriate direction. Each day spent riding through town gives Rufus a 1-in-6 chance of noticing a new mystery, which he will then be eager to solve, and melancholy if not allowed to.",
      "Yellow Beedums: Prances like a deer. Incredibly difficult to ride, and takes a week of practice before you stop having a bruised butt (move at half speed). Moves twice as fast. Only happy when sticking its head through a window and making goofy faces.",
      "Sir Dashfallon: Immortal. Grey. Acts like an exceptionally intelligent warhorse with a peculiar love of battle. Automatically succeeds at all fear-based saves its attacks are boosted to d8 damage for the rest of the day when it does. Whenever it or its rider kills a worthy enemy, it announces a number. It is counting down from nine. It never speaks at any other time. When the count reaches zero, Sir Dashfallon announces \"The circle is complete; the covenant is returned\", turns into a giant crystal shaped like a horse head, and offers to give the party a ride inside him to any location they desire (even extraplanar ones). After discharging this obligation (if applicable), Sir Dashfallon flies into the sun.",
      "The Negahorse: Horse-shaped hole in the universe, filled with stars and inky blackness. Wears an insulated saddle to prevent frostbiter of the rider. Immune to non-magical damage, does not tire, and is capable of running to any named location she has previously visited. Possesses an uncontrollable urge to collide with a regular horse. If this happens, both horses are annihilated in an explosion that does d12 damage to all in 20', gives a random mutation (save negates) to all in 100', and kills all horses in a ten mile radius. It is sold with a hood, so that you can throw it over the Negahorse's head when it catches sight of another horse. (This is the only method the previous owners have had success with, as the negahorse is a powerful runner and jumper. They do not realize how dangerous an horse - antihorse collision would be.)"

He is always eager to sell his normal merchandise, but those who wish to purchase his most ornate works must prove that they are capable of handling themselves in combat against a battered set of animated armor, and are challenged to push the construct out of the 15-foot radius arena without getting knocked prone by it.

      "The shopkeeper is clearly two gnomes with one on the other's shoulders, but they will never admit it. The two, Foggi Ysbeten and Grogel Grogelhome, take turns being the one on top, but never acknowledge the difference. They sell 'human-sized' equipment.",

      "A Goliath, considered large even among his own tall people, known only as 'The Builder.' He crafts intricate toys, gadgets, and trinkets. Working from inside a wagon pulled by two Clydesdale horses, he hunches over his desk with a lantern and a magnifying glass, working his massive fingers to build tiny, detailed devices. If he meets a child, he always gives them a toy for free. He never accepts gold as payment, only more materials for crafting, or if the need arises, a personal favor. He can be commissioned to build specific devices, but prefers not to unless he knows the person well. He sticks to rural towns and villages and defends himself with a myriad of clockwork like devices that are beyond most people's understanding.",

It succeeded but as soon as he cast it he was possessed causing a merge of souls. Azaeli became a devilish sellsman who roams the globe causing mayhem.",
      "Whilst walking through through the run down boroughs of a large city you spy a strange exchange down one of the numerous labyrinthine alleys. A rather large and motley crow sits upon a busted crate. At the base of the crate an alley cat, accompanied by a scraggly litter of kittens, approaches the crow and drops what looks to be a shiny piece rubbish. You look on as both the cat and the crow seem to converse, the low cawing of the crow meeting the desperate meows of the cat. Eventually some sort of accord seems to be struck, and the crow produces a large half eaten fish, dragging it from the crate and letting it plop down on the dirty ground bellow. Immediately the mother alley cat picks up the fish and darts off, her kittens tumbling along behind her. Those who wish to stay and observe the crow for longer will discover that all manner of strays, ferals and other wild denizens of the alleys approach the crow throughout the day, including one or two beggars and street kids. Each time something shiny is produced, and an item from the box given. Sometimes food, sometimes junk, and at one point even a dagger (given to a street kid) is pulled from the crate. At sundown several more crows gather at the spot in the alley and begin to fuss around the crate. Eventually they all take flight, labouring under a sack clearly laden with goods. They cary the sack high above the roof tops, eventually disappearing from sight, their mysterious trade having officially closed for the day.",
      "A series of animals who seem to run every magic shop the party goes's to. They're capable of communicating via telepathy, but mostly prefer to make animal noises. Probably the familiars of some old mage.",
      "A very short wizened old man with a wispy mustache. He runs a pet shop and seems to always be talking to himself. When someone enters his shop he will grab them by the elbow and begin walking them around to all the cages and kennels and tanks. No matter what they say, he'll respond with things like 'Yes, he is a bit tall, isn't he?' or 'Now don't be rude, he doesn't smell that bad.' or 'Ah yes, I remember. You don't want a single pet, you want to adopt a whole family.' Finally he gets to one animal and says 'Eh? This one looks good to you? Excellent!' He then picks them up out of the cage, hands them to the person - again, regardless of whatever the person is saying - and then says 'Now there is just the little matter of payment ... '. Which is when the animal bites or claws the person and then gives the store owner a single drop of blood. Because he doesn't sell pets to people, he sells people to pets."

      "Fugh - This goblin is a bit...  slower than the rest in his tribe, but he's big, strong, and easy to order around. The only problem is he eats more than 3 other goblins do in a day, and he's still growing.",
      "Grishnar, the Rusted Knight - Clad head to toe in rusted, scrounged together armor stolen from unlucky adventurers. He's allowed these trophies as his insistence on 'chivalry' means he'll never try to take over the tribe, and he thinks he's invincible so he'll fight anybody you tell him to.",

      "Mushroo - A shy female goblin who somehow got her hands on an old, rusty harp missing a few strings.

Can be sent down the path to taking levels in bard",
      "Dun bo- A goblin with ears each as big as his head. Is very self conscious about it. Has a massive bonus the listen checks. Usually to hear the whispered jokes about his big ears.",
      "Makarr - a small goblin wielding a massive banner who cannot be persuaded to part with. Adopted by a barrack of orc soldiers who treat him as their mascot, he is always at the forefront of their raids, waving his banner amid the chaos. Is surprisingly lucky when it comes to surviving the battlefield.",
      "King - Bedecked in a cloak and crown stolen from a stage show, he walked into the nearest goblin tribe and asserted himself as the new ruler because quote, 'can't you see this shiny crown?' Regularly sends squads into nearby towns to get him 'Booze and wrenches', pissing off the local bartenders and engineers.",
      "Choppa - carries a device like a tiny guillotine. Sneaks into camps at night, looking for sleeping adventurers with exposed fingers to chop off and collect.",
      "Tipy-Tap - One of the toughest goblins you've ever met. Picked on by other goblins as a child for his name, often joking about his \"tiny tipy-tap feet\" lead him to doing nothing but leg days. Now he's got legs like tree trunks. Can squash another goblins head without even trying. Unfortunately his arms never got much workout so he barely has the strength to swing a sword.",

      "Gubbz - A suicidally brave (and probably insane) goblin with an unearthly amount of luck. He gets easily distracted and dodges most attacks by picking up funny looking rocks, breaking into a spontaneous dance, tripping over his own feet and stumbling out of harms way, etc. He thinks that this 'protection' comes from his ancestors and thus often fights naked.",
      "Old 'Pink-Robes' Rutt - An elderly goblin wearing a pink, hooded robe that looks way too big for him. He wields a wand of smiles that he uses as a walking stick. For some reason it can also cast fireball in conjunction with the original spell, so that his victims smile before they get blown to pieces. He does not speak common and simply smiles widely but confused whenever he's talked to in any other language than Goblin.",
      "Pinkskin - At about three feet tall, with a measly little head, and curly brown hair, Pinkskin is unfortunately the ugliest goblin ever born, with a face only a mother can love. His flat little claws barely even extend past his fingertips and break so easily.",

      "Gleb - A long time ago a goblin tribe was wiped out afterr they tried to play cards with a deck of many things. Adventurers came in and cleaned up the mess, however Gleb lived, he lived because he became a warlock to Enlil, a retired god who needed something done in Unther via XP and magic items that he got from the cards. (FR Setting ) He now travels the countryside on his trusty war pig (Pig not boar) Porkins.",
      "Jot - The oldest of a set of brothers. Jot is incredibly crafty, being well spoken for a goblin.",

Anyone who critiques her, draws her ire and are major villains in her story. Those who support her are written as madly in love with her.",
      "Three Crusts- As a young scout, the goblin became lost and wound up high in the mountains. Freezing and starving, he was found by a woodsman and carried to the woodsman's small home. The man and his wife served him and another traveler up food pulled from a wooden box in the kitchen and gave them a place to sleep. In the night, the goblin arose and grabbed the box, delighted to have found such a prize. To cover his escape, he lit the home on fire and ran into the night. Once he had passed out of reach of any pursuit, he opened up the box. Inside he found three crusts of bread. The woodsman and his wife had shared all but their very last food with him, and in return he had robbed them and burned their home. The goblin flung the box down, and then was sent reeling to the ground by a powerful blow. He looked up into the eyes of the other traveler, dressed in silver armor and holding a mace. The traveler, a cleric of a goddess of justice, had managed to put out the fire before it had done any real damage, and then had come after the goblin. Rather than kill him, he declared that the goblin would serve him for three years, one for every crust of bread in the box. Over the next three years, Three Crusts served as the cleric's servant, then his squire and friend. Three Crusts took holy orders himself shortly after the three years ended, and is now a paladin.",
      "Gulzyat the Undying - This little cursed fellow is a horrible nuisance. He wears nothing but a ratty pelt from a Dire Badger with the upper half of the badger head worn like a helm and the ratty pelt acting as a cloak and an old rusty piece of full plate elbow joint as a codpiece. The badger is appropriate because once you kill Gulzyat he seems to tenaciously come back to life at the worst of times appearing out of no where to exact a bit of revenge for his death. He is just a normal goblin for the most part so Gulzyat is not so much a physical threat himself but more about the ill timing of his reappearance. Trying to sneak around the sleeping hill giant? Not so fast here comes that odd little goblin you thought you killed to make a racket and wake him up. Trying to lie your way past the city guard? Guess what, the little bastard speaks enough common to pop up and let them know what you are really about. Trying to impress a noble, hard to do when a goblin appears chanting your name and peeing on his plate of roast duck. Remove curse only works for one encounter where Gulzyat would have appeared and then he turns up again like a bad penny. A wish can rid you of Gulzyat sending him to pester someone else but the only other way is to trick some other poor sap into killing the little nob and getting someone else to take on Gulzyats ire that is currently directed at you.",
      "Lokey Mogul- Serial killer, chef, and television personality! Hosts a cooking show (viewed on scrying mirrors that some rich people own) called 'Gobblin' With A Goblin' in which he details the process of kidnapping, cooking, and properly serving people. Sometimes has 'guest stars' (either kidnapped people or bandits) that rate his dishes. Is a powerful Illusionist that uses Hallucinatory Terrain to make his victims think they have ran into a dead end and to avoid other people seeing his kidnappings. His kitchens are usually back alleys, abandoned buildings, and other people's attics.",
      "Ukmot, Archfiend Warlock - Considered the weakest of his tribe, he was beaten and exiled. In his rage he vowed his service to Glasya in exchange for power and to advance his goals for submitting goblinkind under his rule and sending his enemies to his patron for eternal suffering.",
      "Boom Boom, the Pyroman(iac)cer - A slender goblin with a nasty lisp, the right half of the face is covered in burnmarks, remnant of one of his most successful experiments, as he would claim. He has a bag with him and you can be sure, one item in there is a firestarter and the rest, some sort of explosive devices. His catchphrase: 'I can make ith boom boom?'",
      "Zamot - an elderly goblin who believes his walking stick has been possessed by a wild(a wolf) god by the name of Ral'tak. He constantly talks to his walking stick as a result and every night he wanders out of his encampment to find a pack of wolves to howl at the moon with.",

      "The Goblin raider, M?d - He is known in these parts. He finds clothes uncomfortable, instead wearing only a loin cloth and coating himself in dirt, twigs, leaves and anything else he can find. Unlike other goblins, m?d doesn't really care for shiny things. Instead, he covets dark things. To this end, he carries a pouch of charcoal to darken the shiny gold coins he acquires.",
      "Gorgeous Garrow the Galiant - This little Goblin bard wears a pirate costume complete with a captain's hat and a fake beard. He plays a violin and sings tall tales of his courageous swashbuckling adventures (he's actually terrified of deep water and has never been on a boat).",
      "Beetlebug Cragmaw: Goblin bard who acts as a spy for secret orginizations around the world acts tough but is a total sweetheart and just wants to make the world safer.",
      "Backbite the Harmless- Goblin Sorcerer and former mob member. Backbite talks like a wagon salesman mixed with a freeform poet. His magic comes from his Divine Soul, much to the surprise of his family. Backbite is now seeking to live up to whatever his 'heritage' is, meaning that he sometimes stops midsentence and says, 'oh, but we're GOOD guys now, riiiight... '",
      "Gorscrik Bleeder- A gloom hunter who seeks vengeance against a powerful Hobgoblin warlord. Gorscrik became a goblin veteran the hard way, in the massed ranks of a barely-armed and untrained horde invading Human lands. Driven on by Hobgoblin masters and clambering over the mounds of their own dead, the wave of green swept over the north of the continent, sacking cities and overwhelming armies. The southland, fertile and lush, beckoned to the goblins. But the Hobgoblin leadership, led by High Chief Captain Druzz'defor, chose to turn the horde against the Dwarven fortress of Merget Mon-Moor. Gorscrik, who was sent as a scout, returned and reported that an attack would be madness. In response, Druzz'defor demoted him and assigned him to the first rank of footmen sent against the Fortress, referred to now by goblins as The Grinder. Facing veteran Dwarves in prepared defensive positions, the mighty green horde was butchered brutally and mercilessly. Gorscrik, by an odd turn of fate, survived the battle, lying senseless in the sea of his slaughtered comrades. After being washed into a side tunnel by a Dwarven Waste Disposal crew, he revived and learned to survive in the hazards of the Underdark. He returned to the topworld hungry for revenge and glory.",
      "Nibbler the Nilbog - This zainy crazy Jester shaman Goblin Nilbog lives alone in swamps. He is like Yoda and will just show up some nights. He just wants food to be honest, but is always down for a good joke or riddle. Will o' Wisps also HATE this guy and will back off when he is around, but he will always comment on the pretty colours. Maybe he will give some magical items or enlighten the party with hints if he is treated very nicely?",
      "Hobbin of the Dirt - A loony, mud-soaked, and scratched up goblin that wanders the forests, believing herself to be a powerful druid capable of communing with the trees. Her only companion is a ferocious and blood-thirsty badger that Hobbin can happily calm with a long hug. Hobbin's (literally) insane dedication to nature has led her to powerful places unknown to outsiders, where the veil between the Feywild and the Material Plane are thin. She does not know what knowledge she sits upon or that the forest has been silently taking care of her.",

She's an honest worker, but is often met with suspicion from patrons due to her race.

      "Fared the Gilded - As an old test subject for the secretive magus Jordroy, Fared was constantly exposed to strange magics, often for long periods of time. It was during one of Jordroy's alchemical mishaps that Fared had he chance to escape his cage and run to freedom, although not before being doused in a variety of mysterious reagents. By the time Fared had a chance to rest and look himself over, the entire right side of his body from knee to ear had transformed into solid gold. This gold functioned the same as his normal body, but gave him the ability to transform a tiny object into gold once per day by touching it with his golden arm. He now constantly travels from place to place, using his ability to get by. He wears a thick black cloak he never takes off so as to avoid getting kidnapped for his ability or worse, taken back to Jordroy.",
      "Glizbik, The Dawn Priest - Glizbik was once a feral goblin that preyed on local travelers with his tribe, simplistic in his fondness for violence and shiny things. One day, he and his tribe raided a lone priest traveling the road. The priest pleasantly divided what he was carrying among the confused hunting party, and gave his holy symbol to Glizbik. He winked at the goblin and told him that when the time came that he wanted something more than this life he led, all he had to do was grasp the necklace and believe. Before the old dwarf could say anything else, the rest of Glizbik's tribe attacked and killed him in the hopes they could find anything he was holding out on. Glizbik spent the next few days in contemplation, watching his fellow goblins squabble over their petty loot and trinkets. He found himself believing that they could be better, and that he should be better too. With that belief, he clasped his amulet and heard the voice of Auphaela, The Breaking Dawn for the first time. The Goddess of the Rising Sun told him of a better way of life, and showed him visions of what that could look like, promising that she would show him the path if he would be willing to walk it. Filled with a flurry of emotions for which he had no names, he made a promise to Auphaela that the priest's words were not spoken in vain, and that he would guide his people out of the dust and into a life of higher ideals and racial unity. He now travels the land with a small group of goblins who share his beliefs, seeking to fill more goblins with the guiding light of the Goddess of New Beginnings. He strives to embody her tenants of charity and respect in the hopes that he may one day be able to atone for the sins of his tribe, his people, and himself. Though he sometimes falls victim to the pettier urges of his race, he always manages to quickly recover and use his power as a cleric of Aupheala to make amends.",

Seeing the sun frozen in place, and being a smart man, Dav knew he had to do something quickly or the world would plunge into chaos. He swiftly sprinted up the frozen sunbeams and used the heat of the owlbear carcass to melt the ice.

Some say it has hundreds of small legs that make it kind of skitter across the ground, but it can swim faster than a horse can gallop. Sometimes it sneaks up on swimmers, and if it's not hungry it just pulls them under and lets them go. Of course old Dav Oket heard about this monster and bet his friends that he could take it on. After days of stalking, Dav finally had a shot with his bow. He was a crack shot, but not an arrow found its mark. The Monster scuttled forward and ate Dav's bow! So the ranger wrapped his arms around the beast and wrestled with it. The fight was so great, so colossal, that it stirred up a storm over the lake. Finally, Dav threw the Monster over his shoulder, and it sailed right over the mountain. To this day, you can cross the lake in safety if you call out, 'Old Dav's a-coming!' and the Monster swims away to the bottom of the lake.",

      "The party comes across a caravan in distress. Bandits have been known to set ambushes like this to catch unsuspecting travelers, but there are also rumours of a merchant caravan that's late returning from the capitol. What do you do?",
      "A lost child wanders the road, heading back the way you came. It's too late in the day to get back to town before nightfall, and you need to be in the next city over by morning.",
      "You see a dying man at the side of the road. If you stop, he tells you that [Person]'s guards attacked and robbed him. You are en route to an audience with [Person] to negotiate a lucrative commission, and as far as you know, s/he is a pillar of the community.",
      "A blizzard swirls up, impairing vision and forcing players to make con saves against cold damage.",
      "A white stag/any other big game animal crosses the road and bolts. Do the adventurers pass on this trophy that could be worth money for its pelt/antlers/alchemical ingredients or do they go hunting?",
      "The party happen upon a hoard of coins (usually gold) in the middle of the road. It's more than they can carry and there's no obvious way to transport it. A group of level appropriate humanoids are circling around, intent on taking the hoard for themselves.",
      "You find the last survivor of a zombie/goblin/werewolf/etc. attack. He/she asks you to bring him back to his guild, which specializes in hunting this kind of monster.",
      "You come across the last survivor of a pack of peaceful werewolves who are being hunted by vicious werewolf hunters. He/she asks you to return him to the rest of the clan.",
      "You stumble into the middle of a fight between bandits and evil wizards fighting over a caravan of potentially valuable supplies. Neither party has seen you yet.",
      "A farmer or other commoner is transporting an offering to a fearsome enemy (giant, wizard, orc chieftain, etc.). He/she tells you that the village has managed to remain untouched by offering livestock/goods/gold in exchange for safety.",
      "You are approached by a zealous group of cultists. They begin preaching to you that the world is going to about to be destroyed by the god they worship, and ask you if you'd like to join their end-of-the-world party (attending reveals that the world is not, in fact, about to end).",
      "While passing through an abandoned farm, you come across a scarecrow that psychically whispers to you. It gives the party an \"impossible\" riddle and claims that if you cannot answer then it will not let you pass. Note: Scarecrow cannot move and players need not answer the riddle in order to simply walk past.",
      "A group of goblins standing on each other's shoulders in trenchcoats trick travelers into coming to help fix their broken down wagon, and rob them for every copper they're worth.",
      "The only way to progress is through the aftermath of a battlefield. Many of the traps put in place by mages haven't been disabled yet, and the party must navigate safely through it.",
      "There is an illusory spell over the forest that they are traveling in that causes people to think that the road is taking them in circles. People who pass the save must convince the others that they are going the right way.",
      "There is a caravan of magical meat traders that are going from city to city. However, they only trade meat for meat instead of trading with gold.",
      "There is a tiny earth elemental trying to learn how to juggle. If the party tries to touch it, an angry mother will come out of the woods to attack them.",
      "A group of teenagers were smoking in the woods and accidentally started a forest fire. Unfortunately, the party is in that forest and needs to get out.",
      "The road comes to a large river. A new, high-quality bridge has been built over the river by a goblin clan who are seeking to overcome evil natures and to make an honest living. They are charging what is, in fact, a high if still fair fee.",
      "The path and map somehow did not mention a mountain that sits right in the middle of the road. The party did not notice the mountain until it was directly upon them.",
      "The village that you come to has just had adventurers a lot like your party come through, and have prepared an appropriate welcome. If your party are heroes, it might be fresh-baked bread. If your party is a bunch of jerk murder-hoboes, it might be tar and feathers.",
      "A large group of pigs are running every which way. A young girl in a ragged dress is trying to herd them together, sniffling slightly. If approached, she explains her father and mother are sick, but the pigs are supposed to be sold at the market, and they need the money for medicine.",
      "A worried-looking half-orc desperately tries to convince your party they are going the wrong way, and that they should take a similar (if slightly longer) trail to their destination. A religion check reveals that he is a cleric of a knowledge deity. If the party ignore him, he tries to convince them for a while, then shakes his head sadly and begins trudging away.",
      "A small stretch of woods are petrified in place and time, completely silent and perfectly still. Anyone touching anything but the path in the forest finds it hard as stone and completely immovable. There are birds and other animals in the forest, but they too are as still as statues.",
      "A vicious squirrel begins throwing nuts and chattering at the party. It doesn't do any real damage, but it is painful and annoying.",
      "A nest of baby hydras! Kill 'em, avoid 'em, or (with a successful handle animal check) take one with you! Where's the mother, anyway?",
      "Someone has left a trail of copper pieces, leading off the road to a cave. The cave is heavily trapped and ends in an empty chest. You hear giggling when the chest opens, but no one is in sight.",
      "A large group of pilgrims and flagellants are making their way slowly up the road in front of you, slowing you down. They make no attempt to give ground to you and eye you with some vague hostility.",
      "A deep moat has been dug across the path in front of you. Two gnomes on the other side are looking at a map and blueprints and arguing with each other. They make no attempt to help you cross.",
      "An 8-year old boy is peacefully leading a giant pit fiend/ Manticore/ Purple Worm on a chain behind him down the road. If asked about it, he laughs and says, \"oh, that's our cow. She just likes to play tricks on strangers.\" He then ruffles the- whatever- and continues on his way whistling.",
      "Your map failed to mention a road inn halfway to your destination. The inn is completely empty with the door torn off it's hinges. With a local knowledge/geography check you know that this inn shouldn't even be here, this was once the location of a grave site.",
      "An armored retinue of Soldiers and Clerics bearing a King's/Lord's/God's banner have set up an inspection point, requiring all passing through to declare their belongings, allegiances and purpose for passing. Zone of Truth, Detect Evil and Good, and Truesight are in use.",
      "You come across 2 NPC's arguing over which one is real, and which is a hallucination.",
      "You discover a 50ft wide flowing river crossing perpendicular to your path. This same river can't be found on any maps.",
      "A great human knight has just died of a heart attack as he travelled down the road. His squire and page have pulled him to the side, and one has gone to fetch help. The knight has powerful magical armor and weaponry which would fetch a pretty penny, and there are robbers about... ",
      "The road is completely blocked off as if an avalanche or rock slide occurred. Problem is the area is pretty flat and you don't understand how the rocks got here.",
      "A group of animals have been killed and aligned in a strange formation with weird symbols drawn in blood. Party could find out this was used for a ritual of sorts.",
      "You turn a corner and the road ahead is blocked by a pool of lava. Upon inspection, there is no heat. Futher inspection will reveal it is a illusion spell. Perhaps a silly prank by a wizard. You can walk through the lava.",
      "As you make your way along the road, you come across a rotting dead animal carcass. The smell is horrid, but it is nothing out of the ordinary. As you continue, a few more animal carcasses are strewn across the road. More and more bodies begin to appear along the road the further you go. You eventually come face to face with a 20ft wall stacked full of bodies ranging from livestock, predatory animals, and even people. The wall blocks the road, and the only ways to proceed include scaling a nearby muddied-with-blood slope, backtracking to find another route, or digging through.",
      "The travelers find themselves at a crossroads, then the same going forward, and again. The party is trapped in a magical loop, until they can dispel it or notice the difference in the pattern, such as flower locations or a bird's flight path.",
      "You were sold bad travelling gear at your last stop - the rations are worthless, the water tainted, the leather goods falling apart.",
      "Flash Flood: A downpour upstream has triggered a flash flood over a low part of the road. Although the water is 3 feet deep, the current is so swift that it will without fail sweep away anyone trying to ford it. Individuals swept away face the risks of bludgeoning, impalement on debris, and drowning. By stepping in it at the shallower edge, it is obvious to even survival novices that it will be extremely dangerous to cross, especially towards the middle. The party can choose to wait it out if they like although it will take a long while.",
      "Stampede: A large herd of bison/gnus has been spooked and is wildly stampeding down the road as it is the path of least resistance. Get out of the way or be trampled.",

      "Bad signs: A jerk has rearranged the roadsigns at an intersection so they point to the wrong places.",
      "Pulled over by the highway patrol: A peacekeeping army-guard convoy is marching through. They are corrupt and will harass and attempt to search the party and may try to take money or goods they find suspicious or the party cannot explain the providence of. They will also apprehend known criminals. The party may get most of their stuff returned by \"appealing\" (aka paying a bribe) to a similarly corrupt local court.",
      "The Wyld Hunt - The fey are out hunting. Beware. They have already chosen a quarry, but don't stick around, lest one of them choose you as their next.",
      "After walking for a good few miles along the path down the clear road, you reach an invisible barrier. Then the illusion breaks - this Mirage Arcane made this deep cave look like a clear plains with a nice lovely stone path identical to the one you've been following. You are half a mile into this cave, and the fey who have lured you here do NOT want you to leave without doing something for them first.",
      "Modrons: Along the path you find a group of modrons (2 monodrones and a duodrone). These modrons were not given the return order during the last modron march (due to complications from becoming attacked) and are still trying to collect data. Upon noticing the party they harass them for data, doing things like surveying them and mesuring the size of their clothes while they are walking. They continue to do this until they either lose sight of the party or are destroyed.",
      "A fire can be seen just under a mile away in an obviously cultivated field, the wind now blows billows of smoke over the road the party is crossing. The field belongs to a local alchemist who has seeded it with various medicinal herbs. The smoke is highly intoxicating, impressing odd conditions and visions upon the party members.",
      "Improper care - the terrain has taken an unfortunate toll on your foot ware. Your soles are falling apart, movement reduced by 33%.",
      "A mounted knight in full tournament jousting gear mistakes the party for his entourage/bodyguard and insists that they escort him to his next competition.",
      "The party come across a revenant who is nearing his target. The target isn't any one in the party but the adventurers have a chance to intervene.",

      "Everyone the party asked in the last town/village/waypoint has said the only safe way to get through the valley is to take the blue path, detailed and maintained by both of the communities it is flanked by. The villagers all said the upkeep was mutual, and that they were on very good terms with the other town/village/waypoint.",
      "Upon getting out of the first town's territory, they find the rest of the path barricaded and blocked, the barricade older and written in an archaic version of the prime language. The trees and animals all look like they are from a different time. There is a 'detour' path but it's filled with primeval dangers.",
      "While traveling the carriage you are riding on hits a rather large bump causing an already weak axel to snap rendering the carriage useless. The party must either find a way to fix the snapped wood so that they continue, or they can try and convince another traveler to help.",
      "You find the rats have gotten into your rations. You'll either need to make constitution saving throws or find new food.",
      "A massive and extremely powerful dragon ambushes you somewhere along your journey through a massively dense and vast forest. It is strong enough to slaughter you all without trying, and is upset that you are not aware of it. Gonna have to talk fast to appease it. It also desires a rare food item you possess, and will allow you to pass if you offer it the food and an appeal to its vanity.",
      "This actually happened to me in a campaign: An axle on the cart breaks and a druid, in an attempt to repair the cart, accidentally Druidcrafts the wooden wheel or another wooden piece of the cart into a bush.",
      "There's been an earthquake, and the pathway is blocked by something. It might be a fallen tree, a crack in the ground, or a piece of land that broke off a mountainside. Either way, it's going to be difficult to get past it and nigh-impossible to get a cart across.",
      "Jack's Lanterns - Strange lights can be seen far away, off the path. They hover over pits and quagmire, and will trap unwary travellers.",
      "Dimensional Instability - There's been a small ripple in the planar fabric between worlds. For a few moments, another plane is open. It might be the Elemental Plane of Fire, the Feywild, the Shadowfell, the Astral Plane, or even one of the realms of the gods.",
      "Mystic Orchard - A large area filled with various trees and bushes, each one covered with different fruits. Food is plentiful, but some of the assorted berries might be poisonous or have a side-effect.",
      "Overgrowth - The path is overgrown with vines, grasses, and tree roots. It is difficult terrain to move past, and will take twice as long to cross.",
      "Oh look, it's a giant stag. Roll 2d4. 2-4 means the stag charges. 5-7 means it looks at your party and moves on. 8 means it bows before you, granting your party a 2-point Charisma Bonus for the next week.",
      "A felled tree blocks your path, and the way around is blocked by dense overgrowth.",
      "You come across a large battlefield of some previous encounter with hundreds of bodies laying strewn across the ground and piles of corpses heaped into stinking mounds, crossing around will take a full day but if they cross through they need to make a Constitution save DC 15 or become sickened with rot from fly bites carrying disease which gives the poisoned status for 24 hours.",

      "A forest fire blocks the path after a thunderstorm.",
      "Snow melt have turned a small creek into a massive raging river. The only bridge is destroyed.",
      "A recent landslide has resulted in several large boulders tumbling into a narrow section of the river, making it very difficult to navigate in the Dory boat the party is traveling in. The boat has an HP of 13, roll 1d4 x 4 to see if it safely makes it through, without the hull being opened up, which would cause it to sink.",
      "A mess of vines blocks the party's way. Seems like a sharp weapon will be needed.",
      "Two bugbears are sleeping off their hangover in the middle of the road. You can try to sneak past, take a detour, or attack.",
      "Part of the path has been washed away leaving a large, deep mud puddle that is difficult to traverse around with the wagon/cart because of the dense bush either side. If the party chooses to forge through it takes them 2d20 minutes, and they end up covered in the thick, sticky, foul smelling mud. If the party chooses to clear a path to the side it takes them 3d20 minutes.",
      "You notice an abundance of sink holes in the field. Players bust be careful with their footing as well as not grouping up to close together.",
      "You find two exact similar dwarfs fighting each other with crossbows and taking cover. Both say the other is a doppelg?nger. None of them is, they're just lost siblings. One is named Thruduanir and the other is just named Greg.",
      "A small red skinned creature sits ontop of a rock on the side of the road. It waves to you and implies that it wants to play a game with you, to pass his test to get his higher devil horns. If not, he vanishes. Roll a d6. 1-2 the devil vanishes and leaves a small purse filled with coin, around 10gp.(the coins turn to lead in one hour) 3-4 a group of (appropriate) undead appears and will fight for their souls to be released by the devil. 5-6 a (appropriate) demonic being is brought into existence, will attack the group immediately.",
      "An old sagelike man sits on the side of the road and begs the party for food, water or gold. -If given food, he disappears and gives a blessing to the goddess of wanderers, the party will not be disturbed on their next long rest. -If given water/wine/ale, the old man hands the party an everflowing mug, containing what they gave him in the first place. -If given gold, he asks the partymember what his favorite animal is and then hands over a golden egg. Soon, a familiar of choice (will grow up to one feet tall) will be born from the egg. -If given nothing, he curses you and will stripe your party of half their rations and water.",

      "Half a skeleton grabs onto the back of your horse/wagon.",
      "All forms of vegetation along a lengthy stretch of the road have been transformed into glass, while the top inch of the terrain has transformed into obsidian. Along the sides of the road are statues of confused, frightened animals made from random rocks and minerals. All organic life in the area slowly begins transforming into various rocks and minerals over the course of one full day, at which point the organisms are petrified. A fully transformed organism may only be cured through use of Greater Restoration or a similarly powerful magical effect. Upon leaving the stretch of the road, any partially petrified creatures have the transformation process occur in reverse at the same rate.",
      "A friendly, sentient dust devil comes across the party and follows them around for 1d4 hours, behaving like an excited puppy for its duration. It communicates by swaying forward and back for affirmation, and left and right for negation.",
      "A speaking animal, like a frog or a bird, is passing your way, looking for direction and a way to be polymorphed back into it's true form.",
      "A bare piece of plains, with a large stone set in the middle. The still legible inscription reminds of a great battle long ago. Ghosts are said to haunt here in the night.",
      "A flat corridor between mountain passes has many windmills dotting the landscape due to the constant and unvarying wind flow. One of the windmills lies in the middle of the path ahead.",
      "A large, deep depression in the ground that appears to be covered in smooth, gray-black glass. If one slips and falls in, it is very difficult to get out.

      "Tavern Games",
      "town city village tavern game games inn",
      "Halfling Toss - Ideally done with friends, sometimes using unwilling patrons, rarely using drunk and angry dwarves, a space is cleared and a target made on the floor, and the boards to the target greased with bacon fat. Two players then \"toss,\" or rather slide, their halfling towards the target, where an ale sits in the middle. Bets are made on who reaches it first, fastest, etc. Halflings may not move towards the drink under their own power, but can attempt to push off later contestents and knock them out of the lane. Normally, there are four teams, and each get's three tosses.",
      "Dragon's Horde - A little like craps meets boxing. A pass chip is moved to a new player each round, and that player is \"the dragon.\" The remaining players throw in a copper, higher stakes can be set if wanted, and an opposite player to the dragon normally has a higher bid (2 coppers, a silver, etc.). Each player that's not the dragon, then rolls two dice, in a closed hand, slapping them on the table. All players show their hands at the same time. Rolls of 2 or 12 means that player is also a dragon, and needs to defend \"the horde\" in the middle of the table. Rolls of 7 or 9 let the player try to reach into the pot and swipe some of the coins with a hand, but they only get one swipe. Dragons can attempt to block or strike the hand, in some games the player, to keep them from the horde, but they get one shot as well. Players need to be fast to grab at the coins without getting hit, and dragons faster and trickier to keep the pile growing. Pirates have been known to let the dragon use a knife. Game ends when a player wants out, but the current dragon keeps the remaining pot. Usually 4-6 players.",
      "Dwarven Miner - A drinking game, requiring a bar maid or tender, the players, a mugs for each player, a serving tray, and rock or gem. The tender pours out beer or ale into each mug, puts the rock or gem in one, and spins the drinks on the tray. The players try to grab a mug without spilling. One point for downing your drink. Two points for not spilling your mug when you grab it. Minus one for spilling from your mug. Minus three for knocking over another mug when grabbing one. Five points if your drink has the \"gem.\" Rounds go until players stop. The loser pays the tab, but gets \"the gem\" and doesn't have to pay next time. Friendly game.",
      "Tavern Joust. One player rides on the shoulders of another. The riders are armed with barstools and must try to unseat the other jouster. No attacks against the mount is allowed.",
      "Red Dragon's Pot - Simple gambling game. Everyone put in an agreed amount in the pool (or pot, if you will). This game is played with a d6 for each participant. The point of the game is to be the last one remaining. Everyone rolls their d6, lowest roll is out. This continues in rounds until there is only one player remaining. (Note: if two or more players roll the same number and it's the lowest roll, those players much reroll and see who gets the higher number to stay safe. Same rule follows where the lowest is eliminated. Say there was a 6, 3 ,2, 2, the 2s reroll to try and get a higher number to prevent from being eliminated.) The winner keeps everything in the pot.",
      "Mindflayer Moat - A seemingly complicated game involving random chess pieces, cards, beer glasses, and of course, drinking. In actuality, there is only one rule. Make shit up and pretend like you know how the game works. While the game doesn't have any real winners or losers, its real fun is from the frustration of people trying to figure out the game. Normally played by drunken old men trying to get a few coin out of local travelers.",
      "Win the Wench - Played between friends. It's a pot win game, where the group takes turns telling tall tails about the other members of the tavern, usually as they enter. The teller weaves a tale, and the others \"challenge\" with coins based on the veracity of the story, or wild and outlandish details. Other versions of this are \"truth or dare\" style, where the group makes wagers on people that come in. Like, \"I bet you can't get a kiss from her?\" Or, \"Five minutes talking to him, he'll throw a punch at you!\" The teller, then goes with someone in earshot to verify the story. If it's true, the teller \"wins the wench,\" if not, or the outcome doesn't come true, the \"wench\" is passed, and the next person is teller with more bids in the \"wench.\"",
      "Vagrun Grash ka Vagrun Gar - Orkish game, sometimes shortened to just \"Vagrun\" (\"Hit with Rock, then Get Hit with Rock\" or \"Rock\"). Players grab two fist-sized rocks and take turns smashing each other in the mouth until one or both players tap out. When someone taps out, the player with the most teeth wins. For some reason orcs don't seem to care about how many starting teeth they have when they play the game, it's not uncommon to see two toothless orcs beating each other to a pulp, much to the amusement of the other gathered orcs.",
      "Impending Doom - Each player puts in an ante, and the dealer declares a card. The dealer shuffles the deck and places it in the center of the table, then each player takes turn drawing cards. If a player draws the declared card, they win. After each player has drawn one card without a winner declared, there is another ante round. This game is popular among rogues, as it ultimately becomes a test of sleight of hand, and as training for noticing the skills and practices behind mechanical manipulation.",
      "Cobra - Played by many races, mostly in areas where life is cheap. The players sit in a circle (sometimes around a table, sometimes on the floor). Each player puts an agreed upon number of coins into a basket with a live cobra. A lid is placed over the top and the basket is shaken (making the snake angry). The lid is removed as the basket is turned upside down. The coins and snake fall out. Each player tries to grab as many coins as possible without getting bitten. There are no turns; players may grab at coins whenever they choose, but the snake may bite whatever it can reach. The game ends when either there are no more coins to grab, all players refuse to try to grab at the coins, or all players are poisoned. Coins left 'in play' are often given to the snake-handler as a 'tip'.",
      "Beer Barter - A game played among merchants. The group nominates one person to be the player. They are given an item of the groups choice, and their goal is to trade that item for a beer. The only rules - \"You can't trade for currency.\" \"You can't leave the bar.\" If the player can't make the trade within 15 minutes, they buy the next round.",
      "Meat Raffle - Several cuts of meat: salted, fresh, pickled, smoked, etc. The cuts come from many different animals. The entry fee is a single silver piece and each person receives one ticket. Over the course of the night a ticket is pulled from the bin and the winner comes to collect their prize from the pile. Prime cuts and particularly valuable cuts are reserved for specific Drawings (typically a few hours apart) and otherwise drawings are held every ten or twenty minutes. Winners collect their meat and can get the kitchen to cook it now, take it home, or donate it to the poor house/alms house down the street.",
      "Knife Throwing - Players roll a d20, adding their Str/Dex mod to hit the target with a dagger. They may add proficiency in daggers. Throw: Result: 0-1 Miss, 2-10 Outer Ring (1pt), 11-15 Middle Ring (2pts), 16-18 Inner Ring (3pts), 19-20+ Bullseye (5pts). Players can agree on how many daggers to play up to. The target doesn't necessarily have to be a dart and may be organic in nature if your players (or NPC's) are that way inclined.",
      "The Tip Jar - A metal cauldron the bartender places on a shelf above the bar. Any patron may throw a coin in it whenever they buy a drink. If they get the cauldron to fall, they keep the full amount in the cauldron. As the cauldron gets fuller, it becomes easier to unbalance. If the jar doesn't fall by bar close, the bartender takes it as tips for the night.",
      "Jack's Ass - There is a donkey by the tavern. If you make it laugh, you win 100 gold. It costs 10 silver to play.",
      "Drunk Musical Chairs - The tavern asks for an entry fee from everyone playing (price varies). The chairs are set up and the local Bard plays the music. * Everyone rolls initiative. Lowest is out. * Everyone takes a drink. * After the third drink, everyone rolls a Con Save, DC 10 * If they fail the save, they are now drunk and roll Initiative with disadvantage. * Repeat the Initiative roll, lowest out, drink, Con Save process. Each round has the DC go up by 1. * Last one standing wins the pool. DM may adjust the DC or when Con Saves begin should they choose. Optional rule: On a Con Save Nat 1 roll, you black out and you're out of the game.",
      "Mystery Jar - Bartender keeps a jar full of copper coins on the shelf. Patrons can pay a copper to guess the amount. When the correct value is guessed, the bartender gives them the jar and starts a new one. Could have other coins or rocks inside to throw off count.",
      "Domino Duel - Play dominoes as usual, but when you set a tile you must drink the amount on the domino facing you, and your opponent must drink the amount on their side. Best played with 4 players.",
      "Troll's Tankard - The dregs of the evening's bussed drinks are poured into a tankard. Patrons bid, counting down from 5 silver (starting bid can vary) for how much they would drink the tankard for. The bar could pay the bid, or the last patron to be outbid can pay (or other methods of payment).",
      "Mixing Bowl - Each player creates a pool of coin that includes 5 copper, 3 silver, and 2 gold. Objective: To bet the highest value, thus winning all the coins in the bowl. Rules: 1. Each round, characters hold a secret number of coins in their fist over a bowl in the center of the bar table. (Players write their bets on a piece of paper) 2. Everyone reveals their coins simultaneously, and whoever bets the highest value collects all the coins being dropped in the bowl. 3. Winnings are removed from the game, reducing the betting pool, and a new round begins. 4. A player must bet at least one coin each round until they run out of coins in their pool. 5. In the event of a tie, the coins stay in the bowl, and the winner of the following round collects both round's bets - even if they were not part of the previous round's tie. 6. If a tie continues until there is only one player left, they claim the winnings in the bowl. 7. If a tie continues until all players are out, the money in the bowl buys everyone in the game (or maybe even the bar) a round of drinks 8. When a player empties their pool, they place one gold coin on the table in front of them that they cannot bet. 9. The last person with coins in their pool collects that one gold coin from each player."

While the birthing was traumatic, the mother and baby are reported to be very healthy, and the energetic Queen appears to be doubly revitalized pushing her ambitious reforms with a new verve. Of course, the Queen is quick to take offense to any hint of slander related to the baby's parentage, something that is difficult to ignore given the child's...  fiendish appearance. The priests of the Temple of Searing Light are scrambling to properly address the Royal Legatee in their next homily, with hardliners threatening to withdraw their support to the crown, but the Queen's loyalists on the street appear willing to squelch any grouse with staunch speechifying and fists if necessary.",

The practice, which involves inhaling Drakevapor through a strange magical device before blowing it out, is highly frowned upon by most of the kingdom, and these \"vapers\" are exposed to silent condemnation by everyone else in the nation. The king is desperately trying to stop the young prince's unbefitting behavior, but the prince is persistent in his \"passion\" and his general unpleasantness.",

This monstrosity is laced with latent magic designed to lessen the chance of drinkers dying from its ungodly alcohol content, and reportedly tastes like \nA kick in the face from a horse.\n After one shot of this drink, the drinker is shunted into a chaotic haze of blurry awareness, bolstered confidence, and overpowering drunkenness. In addition, the latent magic in the brew causes minor, uncontrolled magical effects to occur around the drinker at random times during the haze. The nature of these effects is up to either the DM or the player, so long as the effects are sufficiently insignificant. After 1d4 hours, the haze drops away and the drinker immediately and almost violently falls into a deep sleep so that they may recover.",

      "A coral reef projecting twenty feet out of the ocean, yet is only about ten feet wide. The solid surface on top is pockmarked with pools containing rainwater fresh enough to drink, and the base of the column under the ocean's surface is covered in tasty crabs.",
      "An island about a thousand feet long and a few hundred wide, in a high mountain lake. The water is very cold, largely sterile and devoid of life, and only birds live on the island...  Birds, and someone seeking solitude who has built a shelter there.",
      "This quarter-mile island in the tropical seas is a classic deserted island, complete with palm trees, coconuts, sand, and buried pirate treasure marked with an X made of stones. Unfortunately, the treasure is a trap prepared by a crafty pirate to punish rivals. The brass-bound chest is trapped with a poison needle trap, easily detected and disarmed by those able to, but the gold inside is in fact gold-clad lead, and coated with a deadly contact poison. A faint acidic smell may tip off the wary.",
      "This island in the northern oceans, almost three miles across at the longest bisection and shaped like an egg with a curved tail from an aerial view, is almost completely ringed with harsh thornbushes, rocky outcrops that prove to be very tough climbs and treacherous quicksand. In the center, however, there is a patch of pleasant, temperate forest with abundant fruit and nut trees. It was designed to be the private sanctuary of a druid who has since passed away.",
      "A black sand, crescent-shaped island formed by a volcano that went critical.",
      "A somewhat lush island about 3/4 of a mile in diameter and is somewhat oval shaped. At the very center of the island there is a spot with no plant life, merely gravel. Walk into the gravel and it will all collapse into caverns below.",
      "A rocky column a not even fifty feet wide and several hundred feet tall. It is craggy and featureless save for the very top. At the summit is a gateway seemingly carved from the stone of the island. The gateway has arcane runes along its edges.",

      "This island seems to be in constant movement...  Turns out it actually is a tiny island that sits on top of a enormous turtle that roams the surface of the ocean. The island is a patch of sand and dirt that sits on it's shell, a single, tiny tree sits on top of it.",
      "This elusive place shifts in and out of existence at regular intervals. At the start of very week, the entire island and everything within it is transported to the Astral Sea or back to the prime material plane. The island itself is made of a strange soft rock that is less dense than water. It has no plant life except for a single tree, made of solid amethyst with emerald leaves.",
      "An island in the tropical climate, 4?5 miles and formed by a huge lit vulcan in the center of it. The vulcan is spouting ashes and and a thunderstorm engulfs the island. Apart from the rumbling of the storm you can make out a misterious screeching from time to time, a bird like figure cannbe seen from time to tume between the clouds. (A flock of storm crows have made this island their home) On the shore of the island, ruins of a destroyed village can be found. The water is slightly acidic, the plants seem to be on the verge of dying.",

      "Surrounded by jagged rocks jutting out of the sea, this island is little more than a rock pile with stretches of sand. The only vegetation is sporadic grass and knee high bushes. The fauna is dominated by large crabs that inhabit the shallow rocky shores and seek refuge among the rocks inland during the worst of the storms.",

      "A relatively round, heavily vegetated island stretching roughly 10 miles from end to end. Brief but heavy rainstorms are unnaturally frequent, passing overhead at least twice a day but never lasting more than an hour at a time. While traveling through the miniature jungle composing the majority of the island, conventional methods of tracking or finding direction are impossible, with the plant life and terrain manipulating themselves to create entirely new layouts many times throughout the day. All but the most potent of pathfinding or similar spells fail to take effect within the boundaries of the greenery, and any attempts at teleportation or planar travel are instantly shut down upon casting. It is only during the rainstorms that the trickery of the jungle is suppressed, allowing both conventional and magical means of entering and exiting the vegetation. During the rainstorms, a fortified treehouse can occasionally be seen high in the trees, light emitting from its windows.",
      "Triangle Island: This temperate island is shaped like a perfect equilateral triangle, 10 kilometers a side. The island is made of columnar basalt. Random columns jutting from the seabed are a risk for approaching ships. After navigating to the lone patch of beach, one must climb a column cliff to reach level ground. From the top, adventurers can descend into several hidden maze-like caves and grottos. Prehistoric peoples have left cave paintings, but no natives remain on the island. Unusual minerals disrupt divination magic with their aura.",

About the island, they have notes about a giant shark that lives in the lagoon and a hidden clue about where they hid their valuables.",
      "A small island inhabited by a village of sentient coconut people. They worship a giant baobab tree that gives life to their people. They have basic tools such as spears and dugout canoes.",
      "An island nearly a mile long and half a mile wide. It is flat and shallow, with the entire western half of the island submerging several feet below the sea at high tide. This half is almost entirely made of soft white sand, while the dry area consists of a single, massive red rock. The island is only a mile offshore, and quite close to a small port. It is a common meeting place for sailors and merfolk.",
      "This island consists of a heavily forested sandbank, winding along snakelike for nearly thirty miles north to south, but rarely exceeding 100 yards east to west. It is surrounded by jagged corals that make it dangerous to sail near. A local sailor claims it has moved slightly in recent years, and may not be an island at all... ",

      "This loosely rectangular island is about a quarter mile in every direction, with many thin projections of shoreline at each 'corner'. At its center is a massive, jagged stone nearly 70ft tall and 100ft wide. The island and the waters that surround it are unseasonably cold. It is full of fresh fruit and cool streams, but lacks any sort of bird, reptile, or mammal. The island is bountiful in clams and snails. The whole place is eerily quiet. At night, you may be able to hear a strange sloshing, like saggy meat being dragged along wet sand.",
      "A natural rocky spire stands in the middle of the ocean. The island is barely 200ft around, but coarse rock juts straight of the water and reaches a height of 430ft. Gulls and other seabirds swarm around its pocked surface. The edges of the place are caked in feathers and bird droppings. At the top stands a hulking reptilian creature of great intellect, and she humble implores any passing ship if they could please find a way to get her down and back on the mainland.",
      "This 'island' is some kind of masted ship, made of a strange wood which does not rot, is very buoyant, and is difficult to cut. The sails and rigging have long ago rotted away. It has been stoved in and lists heavily to port, and has floated as a wreck long enough to accumulate enough dirt, algae, plant life and sea detritus to be called an island. The hold is completely packed with earth and no goods are on board.",
      "This fifty-foot long island is a rocky outcrop completely covered in bird feces. A 'cave' on the east side consisting of a crack big enough for a human to crawl into and lie down in is the only useful feature.",
      "This small island is covered in dense tropical jungle. Natives use it once a year (1% chance per three days that it happens to be the day) as a rite of passage in the ritual test of manhood and say it is haunted; in fact, the spirits are conjured by the villages own witch doctor and are harmless illusions. A small hut concealed in the jungle and protected with primitive illusion magic (easily dispelled, 80% chance to miss hut if passing by it in daylight) contains the shaman's dried food supply, some hide blankets, and 1d6 random spell components.",
      "A few hundred feet wide, circular island. The ground is out of stone and covered with wet moss. Broadleaf trees and bushes are growing very dense. The island is somehow moving. Its a giant sea turtle.",

      "A tropical island in the shape of a potato. The island is huge with a lot of hills, a river and a big variety of animals. Nothing dangerous however. A few dozend years ago a man stranded on the island with only his wife. They are dead by now. Their 24 children want to get away from the island and visit the civilizations their parents told them about.",
      "A pear shaped island has a steep rocky mound on the wide end and a sandy beach protruding outward to form the narrow end. At the top of the mound is a small fresh water artesian spring. On the top of the mound a single ancient tree stretches its roots into the pool of freshwater. The tree is a dormant treant who has decided to take a very long nap. You can wake him up, if you dare, but you'd better have a good reason to do so. If woken frivolously, he may be viscously angry with you.",
      "Fuadach - A rocky three mile square Islet, only sparsely vegetated with spindly grasses. There is an abandoned, crumbling, stone compound at its centre, rumoured to have once been the place of exile for a deposed King, who's ghost haunts the ruins.",

      "Skull Island. No literally, it's an island that is the result of thousands of years of time for life and vegetation to overgrow the skull of a massive humanoid creature. The island is almost 4 square miles large.",
      "A barren island, small enough that you can see clear across shore to shore, is littered with skeletons and discarded weapons and equipment. In its center is a grey stone platform with a pristine Chest untouched by time and the weather. Sitting on the Chest rests an ancient warrior wearing tattered rags and a bloodstained battle-worn weapon. This undying fighter has been magically compelled to stay on this island and protect the chest it sits on They will attack anyone who approaches the stone platform, and the chest carries a irrisitable treasure.",
      "Two islands sit connected by a large iron bridge. the larger one is about three miles and in the rough shape of a fishhook. Both islands have rocky soil, bluffs, and are covered in pine. Windstorms constantly sweep the islands from the north and cause the trees to lose all but their southern branches. for some mysterious reason, up to three feet of snow will occasionally cover the smaller island, a stark contrast to the islands tropical location",
      "A large barren sandbar located near [important coastal port] about half a mile long and barely a few yards wide. A noxious black soot covers the island and the bodies of fish that swam too close to the shore. Occasionally the island erupts with green lukewarm flames.",
      "20 years ago a group set sail for this desert island where they swore that they were going to create their own society where they can live life without any government to rule them and truly be free. Nothing but rotting half built houses and bones remain.",
      "A roaming island that seems to move around a lot, nobody knows why, and is covered in thick jungle that seems to sway. In truth, is a small race of mutant dragons that grow plants on their bodies, the island is the ever-submerged progenitor swimming around his children.",
      "A small sandbar out in the middle of nowhere. The sand is a strange, black stuff that is coarse and jagged. There are no features upon this island save the sand. Below, however, lies an ancient, nameless city ruled by a titanic bipedal frog creautre and peopled by a vicious, primitive group of merfolk who worship this creature as a god. The sandbar is the very tip of the creature's temple, which has a roof like a ziggurate the is held up by massive basalt pillars. At night, the followers surface and howl at the moon praises to their god below. Once per week, they claw their way to the center of the island and sacrifice one of their fellow worshippers along with any intruders.",
      "A change of winds can be felt around the island. The wind seems to warm for the climate and it feels extremely humid. Mist starts to spread, a mist with the stench of rotten eggs. The island seems to consist of one big mountain, surrounded by a beach. On its shores you see dead fish, birds and monsters everywhere, mostly small ones. As time passes and the tide comes in, the sand is covered by water and you see water flow through cracks into the mountain. Some time after the tide is at the highest point, a deep grumbling sound can be heard and felt. A huge cloud of water breaks free from the mountain. A wall of steam threatens every living thing to be cooked alive.",
      "An island that's just below sea level, inhabited by fish-like dwarves.",

      "This island is completely surrounded by a tall stone wall, with no door. Within, there is a city with a population that doesn't know about the world out there. They might be fascinated or terrified by the party, but they will certainly refuse to believe in the existence of the outside world. They will attribute the adventurers' origin to some unique deity.",
      "An island filled with dead, dry trees. The soil is covered by a thin layer of ash. Magic users can detect a strong source of dark magic underground. If the party decides to dig down, they will find an old, rotting wizard den, with some valuable loot, but that might give them a disease or insanity if they stay there for more than a couple minutes.",
      "A transparent bubble surrounds this island, that seems to have an isolated atmosphere. Inside, there is tropical vegatation, and a large wooden building. If the party decides to get in, they will meet a friendly elven couple. They claim to have built this house hundreds of years ago, with the help of a mage.",
      "This mountainous island is extremely large, and is filled with massive trees. Odd, oversized birds fly around, and there are several ruined buildings, including a dock.

      "A desert island. No, wait, I mean a dessert island. The island is made of sweets, cakes, and other things that'll rot your teeth out. Even the flora and fauna are edible and full of sugar. Legend has it that they're a caramel dragon on this island, who's breath is molten chocolate fudge.",

      "A tiny piece of dirt in the middle of the ocean. Maybe two people can stand on it if you try.",
      "A perfectly ordinary island, with a beach, and a forest further inland. At least it would be ordinary were it not floating 100 feet above sea level, kept aloft by unknown magic.",
      "A small rocky island with a huge gilded lighthouse dominating its highest point. The cliff faces have been carved into neat terraced gardens, and a cove contains a small but nice harbor that appears to be well equipped for repairing ships- all in all a nice place to restock, resupply, and perhaps do some trading. Ships that approach, however, will discover that the murky waters around this island hide a veritable minefield of shallow reefs, rocks, and shipwrecks, all of which are nearly impossible to spot and avoid. Fortunately, the island's inhabitants are a friendly tribe of kobolds who will happily make skilled repairs to the party's likely sinking ship...  for a rather large fee. The local inn offers a small discount to those staying during ship repairs- bringing down the rates to a mere 'extremely high'. These kobolds are excellent craftsmen, so there are a wide variety of (somewhat expensive) goods available at the trading post. Lastly, the kobolds also charge a fee to show the party the safe way back out to sea when the party goes to leave, which may vary depending on the party's behavior. Should the party complain, the kobolds point out the giant lighthouse they built to warn people. (Brilliant scam or reason to facepalm, it's up to you.)",
      "A medium sized island that is perfect for a settlement, there's houses and a small town but it is completely abandoned. Food was left sitting on the counter, dishes are half washed, clothes were hung out to dry, there simply isn't any people.",
      "A small island that is completely blackened by fire. No evidence of inhabitance but the trees that were located here are now charred and reduced in some places to charcoal.",
      "An island naturally split into two separate islands, a bridge connects them and each side is home to a village that is convinced they are better than the other. They don't fight and they aren't violent to anyone or each other but they are extremely petty and residents will tell rumors about the citizen's of the other town.",
      "An island with the sole use of providing a place to rest for sea goers, there is only a large inn for visitors to eat and sleep, a blacksmith to repair weapons, and an herbalist with basic potions (potions of minor healing, anti venoms, cure poisons). The island is restocked by those who visit and the few people that live here are eager for new people to talk to.",
      "A tiny rocky island with a large tower, the top is illuminated by a very powerful Light spell. This is used as a lighthouse but there isn't a shore nearby, the lighthouse keeper is elderly and doesn't remember why they are there or who sent them.",
      "An island with only one inhabitant, a crazed artist trying to find his muse. He will paint portraits of all who visit him but will destroy them hours later as they did not meet his standards and do not show his inspiration for art.",
      "A large island that changes location frequently, it is actually a huge dragon turtle that people have settled on. They feed it and maintain it, watching its health and ensuring it is happy, and the dragon turtle returns the favor by keeping them safe and allowing them to live on its back. Both parties are very satisfied with this arrangement, though it's a nightmare for map makers.",
      "A medium island home to only rabbits and enough foxes to keep the rabbit population in check.",
      "An island used as a shrine to a storm goddess, all who visit the island are encouraged to leave an offering to her for safe travel. Optional: the goddess is only satisfied with an offering of deep meaning to the party, they must care more for their lives than an object or suffer her wrath.",
      "A group of small, black, rocky islands. The rocks always feel cold to the touch, no matter the weather or temperature of the surrounding environment. A group of large, harmless, scaly lizards live on the islands eating fish.",
      "A dormant volcano covered in dense forest. In the crater of the volcano is a lake with oddly clear water.",
      "A giant knot of vegetation. Kelp extends deep into the waters below, and mangrove-like trees are rooted into the mats of kelp.",
      "A spire jutting hundreds of feet upward out of the water. Small caves dot the surface of the spire, with sea birds making the alcoves their home.",
      "An ugly hunk of rock, 2 miles long, covered in strange plants and fungi. The surface of the island is always oily to the touch, and sea creatures tend to get sick if they dwell near the island.",
      "A small glacier no more than 500ft. wide that has frozen a derelict ship inside it. The ship is over a century old.",
      "A small rocky island. On the South side, a dock pokes tentatively out of the mouth of a cave at sea level. A long staircase winds up inside the rock from the cave to a temple on the top of the island, long abandoned. The Western side houses a small beach, then a sheer cliff overlooked by the temple gardens, now overgrown. The rest of the island is barren rock, rising upwards from the sea.",
      "Geyser Rock: This is a stone shape barely visible below the water and close enough to the surface to walk on. Unperceptive sailors may find themselves beached on its underwater shores. The waters surrounding the stony expanse are warmer and more sulfuric than normal due to regular geysers spouting from the underwater stone floor.",
      "Moss mats: What appears to be a very grassy and very flat island from afar reveals itself to be a free-floating mat of ocean vegitation. It's home to a complex ecosystem of seaweed, moss, bugs, amphibeous fish, and tentacle horrors, as well as several key alchemy ingredients normally only found on the ocean floor. It's too loose to stand on near the edge, but further in it's like standing on a water bed, making it difficult terrain. Don't jump around too much because creatures CAN fall through.",
      "Booty Island: This is just a very large and very thickly forested boot-shaped island. From the outside, it appears to greatly change in elevation. In reality, this is simply the trees growing taller and taller the further inland they are. From the beach, the forest looks rather impenetrable, but it quickly clears up as long spaces vetween larger and larger trees appear. This island is primarily home to three types of creatures: four armed simians about the size of a human that live in the trees and subsist on large beetles, omnivorous boars the size of cars which eat large mushrooms and run down any living thing they see and gore them with their large tusks, and amphibious deer-like fish which move in herds and flee the ocean or the island depending on where they are threatened. There are other animals such as colorful birds and cat-like predators as well. The party may find a destroyed village between the enormous trees.",
      "Mysterious cube: This island only reveals itself when people are within 1 mile of it, at which point it suddenly appears. Its a perfect cube 100?100?100 feet and sits just above the water line. Made of slightly rusted iron in tetris shapes, its only feature is in the exact center. A square pillar of iron 1?1 foot and 40 feet tall, at the top is a gem that glows bright red. If taken or damaged, the island's cloaking disappears and the gem loses its power. The lines between the tetris shapes then begin to glow redly.",
      "Oasis: This is a near-perfect circle of sand. The sandy shore making up the circle is ten feet wide, and 20 banana and coconut trees are equally spaced around it. In the middle of the circle is a dark-blue pond that is terribly deep despite the surrounding sediment. The pond is fresh water, even if it's in the ocean. (Their could be a water purification gem in the pond if they can swim deep enough.)",
      "An island 100 ft x 100 ft made of salt. In a caldera with 15 ft high cliffs surrounding it, lies some sort of wonderland of salt in crystaline form. Crystals wary from grains to 3 ft in diameter. This must have been a place where a falling star had thrashed into the earth, boiling away all the water leaving behind the salt. While covered with seawater in heavy storms, the sun always dries the crater back up, forming beautiful crystals. (meteorite ore can be found if searched for) This island ( 20 square miles and oval shaped) has coral reef beaches of white sand as well as three mountains, overgrown by lush dense jungle. It is always humid and each day around 4 in the afternoon, heavens gates open to unleash a downpour of torrential rain, featuring drops as big as a thumb. Plants are beautiful but carnivorous, only birds reside on this island, even those ar not save from the springing vines in the high trees. When searching the island, remnants of an old culture can be found, the mountains are man made(aztec style) and feature a dark dungeon (in the biggest pyramid) with a lich lord controlling the skeletons of the inhabitants). The story can be decyphered on stone walls inside the pyramid. War between two tribes forces the losing tribe create magical trap plants and retreating into the jungle, so the other faction cant find enough food and gets eaten, gruesome sacrificial necromancy is then used against the losing faction until the whole civilisation collapsed some hundred years ago.",
      "An island shrouded heavily in mist appears once a year not too far off the coast of the mainland. Few have made the attempt to make it to the island, and far fewer have made it back. Those who can see the shoreline from a distance see the spirits of those who died at sea, staring sadly and longingly at the mainland. The island is gone by the time the sun comes up over the horizon.",
      "A large island that has a lake in the center that takes up most of the space on the island. There is a small dock on the lake and another island in the center of the lake with a small hut and another dock with a rowboat docked at it. A hermit lives in the hut.",
      "A half moon shaped island with the ruined remnants of an elven temple. But be wary when exploring the overgrown ruins, an undead werewolf stalks in the shadows.",
      "An illusion. The island looks like it's almost there and you feel like you're getting closer, but you never reach it.",
      "An abandoned resort. This must have been a vacation spot decades or even centuries ago. Now the lasting beautiful architecture is the only sign that it was ever inhabited.",
      "Not so much an island as a wandering clump of Sargasso that circles around the doldrums. Juvenile fish of all sorts shelter here. Lost floating goods can also be found tangled in the weeds. A peaceful leafy sea dragon lairs in the depths of the clump. It gets bored with its treasure collection easily so its hobby is bartering with ships stuck in the doldrums. It offers trades for something else equal in value.",
      "A plain sandbar that appears for only a few months at a time before moving or sinking. A fortune in rare spotted shells desired by many wash up in pristine condition after storms.",
      "A small, flat island with a single structure surrounded by trees, an almost-ruined stone tower. Beneath the tower is a large network of tunnels created by the former residents, a group of wizards and their families searching for a stone of immortality thought buried beneath the island.",
      "A small, heavily forested island, dotted with the ruins of houses a cult built while trying to make it their perfect society. Although the cult is long gone, the demons they summoned still skulk in the tree's shadows.",
      "An island is floating above the sea, about twenty feet from the top of the ocean. On top of the island is a library run by Chameleon warriors who travel around collecting books for their massive library. You can find information about nearly any civilization here, for a price."

      "town city village festival festivals holiday holidays party parties",
      "Festival of Returns - Celebrated by keeping one's door open all day during festivities. In remembrance of the day that countless missing people returned home after an adventuring group of paladins vanquished a coven of hags who had been stealing people away in the night for their rituals",
      "Weaver's Eve - An artful festival for fabric makers. Celebrates the day when the nearby forest's local spider population came to the townspeople asking for help to safeguard their nests from foraging cockatrices. The local seamstresses responded by making large, sturdy fabric webs for the spiders to hide in until the cockatrices could be dealt with.",
      "Day of Stone - Celebrated as a masonry recognition day. Began as a day of remembrance some hundreds of years before when Hunters returned to town only to find that every person had been turned to stone by a roaming Medusa.",
      "The Haunt - A day when people offload their grievances with one another, lest they be haunted by holding it in. In recognition of the day long ago when a necromancer bestowed a curse of silent aggression over the town until people began killing one another, then raising them for his army of dead.",
      "The Honey Moon festival - Every few months, the moon will rise with a golden glow for two or three nights. In the little town of &amp;amp;lt;im bad at names&amp;amp;gt; they say that the moon does this when someone, somewhere, finds true love. During these days, tables are set out in the streets and people ask others to join them on dates, platonic and romantic, underneath the golden moonlight (similar to real world valentines dates).",
      "The Barstool Burning - After an incident where a mimic disguised as a barstool bit off a chunk of a poor patron's bum, the tavern's inebriated clientele burned all its barstools in the street. An afternoon of drinking and building street bonfires made of barstools and other flammables has since become an annual holiday that has spread to all the taverns in the city. The taverns use the bump in proceeds to buy new barstools.",
      "Monster Parade - Once a year, all the cities in region hold a parade where all the participants wear elaborate monster costumes. Larger cities may employ magicians for special effects and have multistory beasts mounted on wheeled carts with movable parts and participants riding inside. The final attraction in the parade is the \"holy paladin\" with an elaborate armor outfit and costume weapons who is driving the \"monsters\" away. The role of the paladin is chosen by popularity contest or some other method, and is almost never an actual paladin. The parade celebrates a plot to deter a foreign attack by making it appear that terrifying monsters had already overrun the streets, yet they were easily defeated and driven off by guards.",
      "The Bath and Swim - This \"festival\" originated in a region with intermittent vampire problems. When another drained person is found, every man, woman, and child in the territory are ordered to assemble and wade across a shallow river. Immobile people are carried and then submerged. A census is then taken, and anyone who didn't show up or refused (even visitors) is captured and dunked. Bored youths waiting for the trials to end soon started a now traditional swimming contest in the deeper part of the river. Thanks to a pair of enterprising visiting bards, a recurring comedy act developed. Two bards playing an oblivious guard and a vampire sit in a single large wooden bath and deliver \"Straight Man and Wise Guy\" skits. The comedy act has an informative end: it addresses vampire powers and weaknesses, and cautions against explicitly inviting anyone into your home, or your bath.",
      "Masquerade ball - An event for the upper classes and nobility. Participants ballroom dance while wear highly concealing masks and costumes. Because everyone's identities are ostensibly hidden, participants are expected to cut loose. Statements challenging authority, outrageous clothing, lascivious dancing, public displays of affection, impoliteness, crude jokes, and open gossip is also permitted. Many champions of silenced and oppressed factions voiced their first manifestos here. The masquerade ball is a can't-miss for anyone investigating aristocratic allegiances and doings, social climbers seeking courtly influence, and underworld rogues looking for high level protection and buyers.",
      "Catacomb Carnival - Once per year in the great cities the citizens head to the catacombs to celebrate another year alive and honor the dead interred in them by properly cleaning and arranging the bones of those that have been in the catacombs for a year into elaborate structures and designs. Any bones that are damaged in any way are burned in a great pyre in the city square and the ashes are used in the mortar of the bone sculptures below. They also leave offerings to the beetles and rats that do the job of stripping the bodies down to the bone. After the catacombs have been cleaned and the years previous dead have been attended to there is a day and night of celebration where revelers light the catacombs and tunnels and celebrate in procession above and below the streets wearing masks of beetles, rats, and skeletons to ward off any dark spirits and denizens that might also haunt the dark recesses below the city.",
      "The Minstrel Masquerade - A yearly festival wherein bards gather from every kingdom to enjoy one another's company. Every bard seeks an invitation to such a jovial event, but only a few will be deemed worthy of winning a \"Bardy.\" The masquerade's origin stems from the tragedy of Gerrick the Mad. Gerrick was a loyal jester, a bard of Lore, whom kept his sleepless king laughing for 3 months straight. Unfortunately Gerrick was only a man, a simple bard, and when the king finally gave word for him to stop jesting, he fell to the ground, stone dead. This festival exists to honor Gerrick and other bards alike for their insatiable desire to be the best artistic minds in their kingdoms, and the horrid sacrifice Gerrick made for the price of his King's smile.",
      "The Salmon Bulb Run - It is this time each year that the giant salmon (which dwell within the nearby rivers) finish their yearly rot on the shores of nearby villages. You see, each year the salmon spawn, die, then float to shore causing a special type of psychedelic river mushroom to form on their carcasses (after they rot for approximately a year). These mushrooms are collected and shared amongst the Firbolg community as a right of passage.",
      "Winter's Ritual Day - To prepare the day before, a branch of the sacred tree is cut and carved into a bowl, in it, runes are scribed asking for what you want come Spring and the next year; fortune, fertility or good health and inside is placed a special candle. After midnight, the candle is lit by a special bonfire created by the temple. A special ceremony is held at midday, where the priest incants a ritual spell ceremony, asking that the city be warded from the Spirit of Winter till next year. After this ceremony, which lasts 5 hours, the people drink ale and sup broth from their bowl cup (candle still lit hopefully), until midnight when they blow out the candle. If your candle goes out beforehand, terrible luck will befall you in the coming year.",
      "Day of Mending - A celebration to better one's community and strenghten the bonds between townsfolk, this holiday is a day when tailors, crafters, smithies and similar trades set aside their work for a day offer their services for free on small projects for members of their community. As the holiday has grown, it has become a tradition for others to offer their goods and services to the community as well: bakers give away small food stuffs, taverns offer drinks on the house (one per customer!), and musicians and artisans flaunt their talents to all. Many enjoy the holiday as an opportunity to bond with their neighbors and community, while the more savvy use it as an opportunity for self promotion. The primary tenet of the Day of Mending is that old grudges and quarrels are set aside, if only for the day, and folk put the community ahead of the individual before the old business resumes on the following day.",
      "The Lovers' Return - One night each year, it is said that the spirits of a young man and woman return to roam the town where they died, looking for each other. Old tales tell of the young lovers kept apart, until one committed suicide from grief, only to be shortly followed into death by their partner. Now, the oldest townsfolk whisper of seeing the crimson specter of half-seen figures, sometimes a young man, sometimes a young woman, roaming the town on the night of the Lovers' Return, rapping lightly on the doors of homes to be let inside to search for their lost love. The townsfolk believe that hanging certain totems around their entryways will keep the lovers from coming to their doors, but even so, every few years a young man or a young woman goes missing on the Lover's Return, presumably taken away by one of the specters mistaking them for their lost partner.",
      "Winter's Offering - An old holiday, mostly celebrated by rural farming communities, it serves as both a celebration to venerate the old gods as well as preparing the villages for the winter to come. After the fall harvest, each household is granted a number of bushels of the food grown, while a large portion of it is prepared and sealed in unadorned clay urns to be buried in the ground and kept in reserve for the cold, hungry months of winter. As well, the villagers bury the bodies of their young at this time: the stillborn and the infants who passed in the previous year, their bodies prepared and buried in urns painted black, offerings to the old gods. The old midwives of such communities often keep unruly children in line with tales of how the cries and tears caused by misbehaving children echo into the ground and cause the blackened urns to crack, prompting their buried occupants to crawl their way out to the surface and drag away bad little boys and girls.",
      "Festival of the Sashes - to commemorate the purge of a despotic royal lineage centuries ago, when the ruling family was chased out of town by the commoners, their clothing stripped of their bodies as they ran through the streets. Groups and families prepare mannequins adorned with colorful sashes, each trying to make theirs the most elaborate and festive. The mannequins are then hoisted on poles and carried through the city. The groups race from Royal Plaza to the city gates. People line the streets and try to grab and tear handfuls of the sashes and ornamentation off as the mannequins pass. The atmosphere is very festive with public drunkenness and groups of young people chasing after the mannequins.",
      "Week of Rest - Neighbors take turns cooking meals for each other. Based on when a plague swept through the town and some got better while others got sick.",
      "Monument Race Day - It is said that when a near by volcano erupted destroying the old town, after evacuating their families many of the villagers returned to move the stone monument from the old town center to the new town's location. In honor of this deed, every year on the anniversary of the eruption, the townspeople form teams that carry replica monuments in a race from the site of the old village to the monuments's current location. Afterwards the town celebrates by having lava soup (a spicy red tomato based soup), with monument shaped bread rolls.",
      "Lamentations of the Cinders - a somber day of reflection on the anniversary of the Great Fire that killed thousands. At third bell after noon, which is when the fire began, people begin silently filing from their homes. Everyone covers their faces with soot and ash. Particularly devout people or older folk who lost everything in the fire may go completely naked and cover their whole body in soot. Citizens keep their faces downcast as they slowly walk a circuit around the neighborhoods that were most affected. A bell tolls every minute for the lives that were lost. At sundown everyone quietly returns home. Recently people have begun to include a great feast of preserved foods, like jerky, salted fish, and dried fruit afterwards.",
      "Last Tidings - It is said there once was a witchy lass who fell in love with a sailor. He went to sea and for twentyfive years she would wait for him at the sea cliff until the last tide went out at dusk. On the final night of her vigil on the last outgoing tide of the year she received word that her lover had perished. She cursed and vowed to the heavens that nobody would ever have to suffer and wait as long as she did for closure. She performed some unknown ritual and ever since that night, on the last out going tide of the last day of the year, anybody who whispers the name of a loved one on the seaside cliff will either hear the name returned meaning they were still alive or hear the cry of an albatross and know them perished. Two night long festivals have arisen one mourning the other joyous as lovers learn the truth. It is no coincidence that many of the single participants find comfort and more in each other's company.",
      "Wall of Melons - A hundred years ago the city was under siege. The invaders climbed a wall to get inside only to be rebuffed by peasants who tore down their own homes to toss rocks down on the climbers. The day is celebrated by a committee selecting a portion of wall up witch a the town's young men try to clamber. At top are an equal bumber of lasses armed with melons both ripe and rotten. It isbl traditional for the first climber up to ask for and be given the hand in marriage of his choice. The climbers are protected by feather fall spells and blanket carrying elders.",
      "Sweet Night - The orchids of fruit trees in the town's fields are pollinated by bats from a local cave. This wasn't known until a hundred years ago when a vampire ravaged the country side. It was tracked back to the cave and burned out, scattering the bats as well. The next years harvests were bad until a traveling holy man told the villagers they must lure the vats back. This was done by pouring syrup and other sweets out on a long path from orchards to cave. It worked and has become an annual event to remind and thank the bats. The sweets used have become candies for children and alcohol for adults. It starts with a barnfire at dusk and culminates in a long hike to the cave. Dancing and costume wearing is common as well as many bat theme toys and souvenirs.",
      "War of the Monsters - An Olympic sports like event with many different athletic competitions and games. The main event is a destruction derby style event where groups make \"monster wagons\". Essentially people driven/powered wagons/carts that are made to look like monsters of the world (dragons, dire animals, beholders, etc). The goal is just to disable the opponents wagons, not hurt the drivers. Last monster wagon still able to roll wins. History harkens back to a day many many years, when several large wild monsters wandered into town at the same time. They ended up fighting each other rather then attacking the people, in a territorial dispute. This gave the civilians time to evacuate and adventurers time to gain control of the situation. Contradictory stories developed how one monster (it's always a different one, since no one agrees which it was) was actually there to save the City from the other monsters. As several monsters actually escaped, this \"hero\" monster is said to still be out there guarding the city. People in the city are split into groups by what monster they believe is their guardian.",
      "Day of stillness - No-one goes outside or opens doors for 3 days. Very worrying to newcomers to the huge city. It is surreal to see a giant city completely still and silent. Almost no lights and no answers. In remembrance in how they barely escaped the plague by not greeting any infected during those trying times.",
      "Day of the Hawk - Adepts at the shortbow and longbow compete in a test of skill and accuracy (ex. piercing a thrown copper penny-sized item in the center), hitting fast moving targets from horseback. Gnome artificers, smiths, and other weapons craftsmen travel to the city from far and wide to tout their new inventions and wares. The festival began when the city was a small village and those who came of age had to prove their proficiency with the weapon as part of demonstrating their skills in order to successfully hunt and defend the community.",
      "The Day of Ribbons - An annual occasion where beautiful ribbons are tied to posts all over town. When asked why, people only give a somber look. Nobody speaks about it, giving the impression that it's disrespectful and insulting to do so.",
      "The Night of Burning - In memory of the defeat of an ancient black dragon that had kept them in slavery, this town has an annual tradition where they kill, cook, and eat a juvenile black dragon.",
      "Orctoberfest - A yearly weeklong celebration commemorating the defeat of a massive army of orcs that had once besieged the city. Lots of drinking of fermented beverages, dancing, and general public revelry.",
      "Market's Day - A day of great deals and bargains from merchants and vendors. It marks the beginning of the new market year and celebrates when the open trading and selling of dwarven and elvish wares to humans was legalized throughout the land.",
      "Candlenights - A night when the entire city holds a candlelight vigil until the dead of night, and then exchanging gifts and celebrating with a feast. Groups of families and neighbors stand around the city in patches, while holding their candles up high. This commemorates the time when a group of adventurers killed a nest of gold dragons, relieving many of the farmers of the fear of being killed and their crops burned. The adventurers brought back the dragon's hoard to share with the town, but because of a raging blizzard, had to be guided in by groupings of torches.",
      "Day of Snakes - a day literally celebrating the existence of snakes. Vendors sell all kinds of snake-related items, restaurants serve dishes with a bit of snake flair added on, and people release their pet snakes all around town. This goes far back to when there was a large rat pestilence in the town, and it looked like it would never get better until a random snake merchant came to town and offered to begin breeding snakes for them in order to control the population. Disease rates fell, overall cleanliness increased, and the town felt better overall after the rats were driven down to a dwindle.",
      "Propitiation of the Twins - around twenty years ago a pair of shooting stars appeared in the night sky. Soothsayers and astrologers predicted that this would usher in a new age of prosperity. People began leaving offerings in public squares to entice \"the Twins\" to bless their household. Now, every year on the anniversary, people have continued the tradition by lighting two candles and leaving a small bread cake in a public area at dusk.",
      "Boulder Pushing Day - On this day every year, the town splits into 2 teams (east and west). Using the whole town as a playing field, they attempt to push a boulder sized ball (many years ago they realized that a real boulder caused too much damage to the town)towards the opposite side of town. The winning team must push the ball into the outskirts of the town on the opposing side. It's a friendly competition akin to a high school sports rivalry. Those who cheat or intentionally hurt others are looked down upon by their peers. The town sits in a u shaped valley that they say the gods carved out by rolling a marble on flat land.",
      "The day of Ashes - more of a ritual than a actual holiday. At this specific day of the year, the towns women get dressed in white and their faces are covered behind a veil. They roam the streets in packs singing and dancing, while the men, all dressed in black, try to coerce the women into having intercourse. Women are treated like goddesses, gifts are given to them and they have free choice of taking or refusing a partner. Each woman has a pot filled with ashes with her. After they have found and bedded their man of choice, they empty their pot onto his clothes, so the other women know not to touch them. This tradition comes from ancient times, when after a volcanic eruption the lands were covered with ashes and many people were killed by the initial eruption or starved to death in the aftermath of the event. To ensure the survival of the ancient tribes in this region, the council of all tribes instated the law of reproduction. What the town celebrates today is the day for the gods and the women, who ensure the succession of their lineage.",
      "Festival of the Drink - Long long ago, a small group of dwarfs set out into the wilderness to establish a new outpost for the glory of their empire. When they finally settled down, they were quickly able to establish a secure outpost with plenty of food, but soon they realized they were missing one of the most important supplies of all. Alcohol. Without this necessity, order soon began unraveling in the fledgling outpost, until the lone brewer was forced to improvised. Facing no other choice, she ordered everybody to gather as much of any kind of fruit that they could find. Once the gathering was complete, she worked tirelessly for a week straight to make alcohol out of anything the other dwarfs had brought, churning out such strange brews such as cherry wine and plum cider. At the end of this massive burst of brewing brilliance, the anxiously waiting dwarfs were finally rewarded with the finest tasting drink they had ever tasted in their life. In remembrance, the now flourishing Dwarven outpost celebrates this event in it's history by holding a festival every year where brewers compete to create the best brew possible from the local fruit chosen for that year.",
      "The Sun God Observation Day - On this day all the village observers the sun god. I.e. stare at the sun as long as possible. The people at the village do this because an old witch told them that it would prevent them from seeing the destruction of the village. Since everyone is mostly blind her prophecy seems to have come true.",
      "Wishmore Night - The city holds a festival at the docks, all walks of life are included and encouraged to mingle with each other. Everyone, either individually or in groups create floating wreaths in whatever way they want to present it. At midnight when the water is still, the leader of the city will wade out into the water and release their wreath first, as an offering to the gods. Everyone in turn will release theirs following the leadership, before returning to the festivities which will often go long into the next night. This celebration is to thank the gods for a bountiful year, or even a year of character building (in case of hard times). It is to mourn those lost in the Shipping routes and to pray for the safe return of others. If the water isn't disturbed except for the wreaths, it is fabled to be a year of easy storms for the sailors. It is also of note that these wreaths never ever turn up anywhere else in the world. They disappear completely.",
      "Celebration of Destruction - The Nine Hells love the awakening of the tarrasque so much that they make it a festivity. The celebration comprises of feasting upon whatever the titan destroyed and watching it as it rampages through entire cities, leaving nothing but rubble and dead life of all varieties in its wake. After the gargantuan beast falls asleep once again, all of devil kind praise the strength and ferocity of the powerful tarrasque.",
      "Ale Day - A dwarven celebration that simply commemorates the invention of their favorite drink. It quickly spread to many other humanoid peoples. Dwarves and satyrs love it the most.",
      "Owlbear Memorial Day - Elven cities that use owlbears as defense use this day to give thanks to the beasts that have protected their land for decades, sometimes centuries. The whole town offers food of all kinds for the creatures below. It's very easy to argue that the owlbears enjoy this day more than the elves above ever could.",
      "Festival of Life - A celebration of the Upper Planes where the denizens of the heavens celebrate the good in every creature of the Material Plane. Commonly occurs when large amounts of good, neutral, or unaligned creatures are born. This involves animals and humanoids alike. A huge feast is held with some of the most delicious food in existence.",

For months before this day, humanoids all across the Material Plane prepare songs, plays, dances, paintings, sculptures, and many other forms of art.

Silver dragons also love to celebrate alongside the humanoids that have arrived.",
      "Beholder Day - A holiday invented by beholders to celebrate themselves. They give themselves presents, and demand that their servants get them presents or they die. If a cult has decided to worship the floating aberration, the beholder will only have to remind its worshipers once and it has a myriad of presents coming its way. Unlike normal holidays that occur annually, Beholder Day happens once every week.",
      "Cliffton Day - Cliffton was a local legend who long ago had defeated a demon water elemental which came upon the small fishing village of Mistwood. They celebrate his triumph every year with contests which correlate to what traits he was known for. Whoever wins any of the contests then participates in a final contest, the winner of which is given the title of \"Aspect of Cliffton,\" and is then invited to participate in a ceremonial recreation of the famous battle. They are given a costume and Cliffton's old ax and told to strike down an effigy - a standing effigy of the demon is already in center of town, but underneath the rags which make up the costume is a bound man, the village drunk, being put to death without knowledge of the adventurers. Maybe now that the adventurer is close to the figure, they can hear strained breathing amidst the cheers and song of the villagers. If they refuse to complete the ceremony, the same water demon who attacked the town years ago rises from the nearby lake and threatens to destroy the town once again. As it turns out, the killing of a man in the ritually-prepared town square once a year is part of a ritual that keeps the demon at bay.",
      "The Betrothment Battle - Every year on the first weekend after the Summer solstice, the town plays host to a wrestling tournament and exhibition. Hand to hand fighters from across the realm come to the town to prove their mettle, and rings are prepared for non-tournament participants to settle small arguments that have built up over the year. Named for a famous fight in the town at the wedding of the Mayor's son and one of the prominent merchant's daughters that saw the merchant, the mayor and most of their families tear apart the public house, the tavern, and a stable in an hours long fight.",
      "The Wardens Gauntlet - In the spring the city's best and brightest face each other in a series of physical and mental challenges. Some are complex rituals, puzzles and riddles testing mind and spirit. Others are tests of endurance, agility, and strength. Betting and boasts are a much enjoyed portion and the contests themselves are openly viewed by the public to cheer on their favorites. The top three are given the honorary title of Warden followed by celebration where the previous Wardens hand off the mantle to any new Wardens or retain their station from the previous year. These Wardens represent the common people in matters of ceremony and any concerns or grievances to the Crown and city councils until the next years contest. Being a warden is often the path to guild leaderships or council seats and even titles from the crown. The history behind the trials and celebrations is vaguely remembered from the time of city states when open warfare was avoided by settling issues between the Wardens of each city state. There was also a darker reason for the intricate rituals and ceremony. Now considered just a spiritual and mental exercise, they serve an unknown purpose strengthening ancient Runes and Spells against something truly horrific that is ever vigilant and hungry.",
      "Stabbing Day - Using fake daggers the populace honors the day a group of rouges saved the city from a dragon attack. It's exactly what you think, expect red dye stains.",
      "Rom'Chuk - Local barbarian tribes meet together in an unfortunate city and hold a Dwarf tossing contest. Use of Gnomes with fake beards is extremely frowned upon.",
      "Siggi's Birthday - A great shield maiden gave her life to save the city. Women can let anyone they are sweet on know by picking them up over their shoulders and hauling them off. Siggi wasn't known for her subtlety. Rooms at the Inn are free in her honor.",
      "The Games - A week of festivities that include games of all types under the sun; from dexterity-tests like obstacle courses, to strength competitions such as log-tossing, and even an academia note to it, like a spellcaster's competition. This week of fun was created some time ago when a tyrant ran the city with an iron fist. Once a year he would force his supplicants to participate in crazy games which usually ended in their death. Once he was overthrown, the citizens opted to keep the week of festivities, whilst removing the \"death\" part. It helped the community grow closer, keeping those with terrible ambitions out.",
      "The Pilgrimage - A day when every person in the city is expected to \"carry their weight\" and bring their greatest distress out in the open, so that their neighbors, friends and community may support them in earnest. Those who refuse to participate are exiled from the community until they complete a pilgrimage to the neighboring continent and bring back something that will actively make their community better; be it money, food, or magical wards. This is a practice from when the city was still just a fledgling town and every person needed to pull their own weight, and everyone relied on everyone else to support each other.",
      "Lottery Day - A crop fertility ritual where outsiders are encouraged to attend. Eventually someone is picked at sundown and stoned to death by the crowd. Do not take the raffle tickets they offer... but there are prizes afterwards.",
      "Day of the Horn - the ceremony draws in tieflings like moths to a flame. Almost hypnotized by the low droll of an ancient obsidian tiefling skull horn being played amongst the music. Dusk brings the climax of the festival where all the spirits of an ancient battle posses the revelers and show them an ancient battle where a contingent of tieflings rebelled against their fiend masters and joined with the townsfolk to drive the demons back to Hell. The leader selflessly gave her life to save her comrades and new friends by blowing a smoldering hole through the chests of no more than 15 fiends... leaving just her skull. \"We Remember\" is the mantra and afterwards the tieflings are thanked and cared for with the thought \"We can be more than the sum of our parts\".",
      "Madel's Star Day - A meteorite fell to form a crater where a town eventually sprang up. The 5 meter rock absorbs all hostile magic and steals any illusions. The soothing rhythmic glow is amazing to behold. Only a handful of elders have metal bracelets fashioned from the meteorite that allows them to cast spells in town. Only one new one is awarded every century. In town it allows for casting of spells, outside of town it has a chance to absorb a hostile one (even your own). The properties of the stone also royally mess with any Warforged that come into contact with it.",
      "Grey Snow Day - A volcanic instability in the area uncovered a ruined fiend city. Excavations uncovered ancient masks that the party goers wear. The volatile nature of the masks grant a limited form of fire manipulation after sun down. The party notices that a vague form of possession is slowly corrupting the crowd every year.",
      "Fomarath Day - Laurel and oak wreaths are adorned and offerings prepared for the four treefolk guardians in a nearby permanent druid grove. A group of Hill Giants were about to lay waste to a group of farmers when a druid and his party drove them off. The druid stayed behind for a year to make sure the spell would stick. The treefolk actually love the townsfolk and have attracted other peaceful sentient plants.",
      "Craghoof Moot - A nomadic band of centaurs and a nearby halfling settlement have a very intertwined history of one ancestor saving another or one group saving the other from invasion. The most noble thing a member could do is swear an oath to one another to ride together for a year and a day protecting the territory. The amount of high grade alcohol and mead available is mind boggling. Watching halflings in war paint and centaurs in straw hats and vests is quite hilarious.",
      "The Druid Chain festival - As a last ditch protection against incursions into this dimension three druids, twelve elementals, and three dragons can unite and merge for a primordial ritual called a Gaia Chain to drag whatever horror that threatens all existence into the maw of the planet itself trapping it within the molten core for all eternity. It kills all those involved and as such the three temple locations became holy places to all forms of life. It is the raw elemental fury and power of the first ones that saved the world are remembered in giant soul crystals that once a year show the images of these lost heroes.",
      "Broken Toy Day - Warforged holiday marking their Independence.",
      "The Anniversary of The Great Mayhem - Recalls the day tribe of barbarians, orcs, and goblins laid absolute waste to a city of necromancers, warlocks, and wizards.",
      "Eeling - every autumn as the eel population in the local reservoir grows too great, the Swanmay invite the local village to come and collect as many as they can stock for the year. While fresh eel is on the menu, the festival itself is a community occupation, jarring eels, processing oil from them and otherwise making sure that what they want will keep until next year. Large communal tables are set up in the town square and the locals gather early to get a place at the centre most tables where gossip and ale flow strongest.",
      "Digging High - At summer solstice the various dwarven families of the area come to The Kin Hole, where they will mine as one for the three days of the festival. The hole itself is barren of valuable minerals, but the myth that the families' ancestors divined great wealth for all dwarven kind at its completion still exists. While much merriment is made by the dwarves, the presence of outsiders is an immediate dampener.",
      "Gluttony - though not a festival per se, the first two months of the year are always eagerly anticipated by the hobbi...  the halflingses of Portree. The tradition of the wealthier houses organising lavish bashes during the time as a means of canvassing has replaced a very loose sense of meritocratic governance with a very enthusiastic intoxicracy.",
      "The Quiet - in the old days, the village of Pertiv was in a most precarious position. Early settlers had grouped to farm an area which they only later realised was threatened by orcs, owlbears and darker things from below. While everyone celebrates the heroes who saved the village all those years ago rambunctiously in Spring, in late autumn the people remember the early days of fear and salvation by drinking heavily together in silence. Any but the most necessary and cursory communication is looked down on, and there are those in the village old enough to remember those times from their childhood.",
      "Fyre - The burning of the Winter Witch. They say that the Winter Witch (who is the spirit of winter) is dull and dreary, but can be driven away with humor and merriment. Villagers celebrate by erecting bonfires and once the sun touches the horizon they are set alight. They drink mulled wine, play games in the snow and sing crude songs to drive the Winter Witch away.",
      "Grimm - Orcish first blood ritual. An orc is a child until they are blooded, among the more civilized tribes of orcs this takes place in a festival called Grimm. Those deemed worthy or are brazen enough to try form a Wog or raiding party then a suitable target is chosen usually small Kobold warren or goblin outpost. All participants must bring back a heart for Grummush (their god) and a head to prove their prowess.",
      "Spring Break Wizard Demolition Derby - A popular beachside town is inundated by hundreds to thousands of student and apprentice wizards from several large nearby schools out on holiday break. The wizards inevitably form carousing groups, get absolutely sloshed, and then try to show off their spells to intimidate rival schools, impress potential dates, or simply cause chaos. In order to keep the wizards out of town proper and redirect the damage, the town sets up beer gardens, bathrooms, dirt cheap \"inns\", and other sacrificial establishments on the beach. The student wizards naturally make it their goal to destroy absolutely every temporary structure they can, culminating in a massive destruction derby on the final night. Meanwhile, the city residents cower and hope the dispatched army can keep them from invading and burning down the town, again.",
      "Spring Break Playwright Championship - A popular beachside town is inundated by hundreds to thousands of student and apprentice bards from several large nearby schools out on holiday break. The bards inevitably form carousing groups, get absolutely sloshed, and then try to outdo the acts of rival schools, impress potential dates, or simply make a name for themselves. In order capitalize on their creative output and increase tourism, the town builds temporary theaters on the beach. The student bards naturally make it their goal to claim the most audience. Students create original productions in several different categories, marching band, full orchestra, historical drama, tragic opera, comedy musical, dance, etc. and debut them head to head against rival groups from all the different schools. The one who captures the most audience wins. On the final night, all the student bards join together for an all night jam session. The city residents who aren't spectating are out cold after over-drinking during productions. (Free alcohol is often used to bait audience members.)",
      "Spring Break Ascetic Training Festival - A popular mountain town is inundated by hundreds of student and apprentice monks who jogged hundreds of miles to sit under cold waterfalls made of fresh snowmelt. The monks tend to be fairly orderly since this location is a prime spot to focus one's ki and discover new techniques. Some waterfalls have better reputations than others, so the student monks will challenge each other for superior meditation spots. The poor fasting students monks tend not to bring much revenue, but tourists who want to watch them fight do. The town constructs several \"arenas\" sculpted from natural materials with silenced stands so the monks are not disturbed in their combat or meditation. The town hosts a streetside festival with many booths on the final day with rich foods for the starving monks and tourists to enjoy. Some more enterprising monks also do demonstrations or offer basic self-defense classes to tourists.",
      "The Bathing - Held at the height of summer. A highly respected priest started this tradition many years ago for those who could not afford to enter the elitist bath-houses. Townspeople gather at the calmest part of a great river just outside of town and bath naked. Considered a family friendly event, those who attend forgo their qualms about nudity and know that all are equal in the eyes of the constantly moving water.",
      "Lock Day - A small town dug up a mountain 90 years ago to make room for a new city hall, but ended up finding a black safe with an unbreakable lock. It can't be moved or destroyed by any means (even a disintegration spell). Every year, they have a big festival where people try to open the lock. Everyone expects them to fail, but it's the fun in trying. They amp them up too; an announcer holler their praises... \"weighing in a 220 pounds, the scourge of Neverwinter, the axe-wielding monster, [barbaian character name]. But there's drinking, dancing, a ceremony from the town's Cleric, trading, cookies and cakes for sale. It's a wonderful good time. Then... one day... the safe opens by itself.",

      "Celebration of Armistice - Once a year, the ambassadors of every major city in the neighboring continents bring gifts to all the smaller hamlets and towns around the land. Gifts include anything from supplemental food to last for a long winter, new technologies, mages looking to relocate and can lend a hand to smaller communities...  This tradition goes back some centuries, long enough that even few elves remember the origins. Legend says that a great tyrant sought to control the lands around, and a massive war raged for a long time. Eventually the tyrant was assassinated from the inside of his court, and his officers extended an olive branch to the peoples around, before disappearing themselves.",
      "Festival of Limitless Water - A yearly celebration in town, where townsfolk race boats, swim, drink locally brew beer and feast on roasted fish.

      "Nymm - The Grand Cookoff - Contests of the best food and drink. It's held in Gatherhold by the House Ghallanda. The roots here go back a very long time to when the local Patriarch would force his cooks to eat their dish in front of him, to ensure that it was not poisoned. Long after he died, the tradition was carried on, but without the terrible connotations.",
      "Lharvion - The Costumed Carnival - Everyone is in costume and there are costume games.

      "Day of the Siren - Quite unnerving for a first time traveler to witness. About 1/3 of the city's population will meet in the square every 3-4 hours during daylight, and only once after nightfall. They will scream, shriek, wail, shout, or otherwise make vocal noise at the highest possible volume. This came about as a defense from a siren who once lured too many of the city's capable workers during a particularly hard summer.

Anyone who asks them to keep quiet is met with a barrage of rotten fruits and/or vegetables. This comes from a long time of religious oppression brought by a cadre of evil paladins. The singing was the first act of rebellion, and the rotten fruits signify when the city folk began attacking to drive them out.",
      "Sturgeon's Wish - people catch wild sturgeon in the nearby river, put them in portable tanks and spend the day feeding them all kinds of crap before sending them back off to the river.

      "Bargaining Day - A day when all villagers have a chance to ask their greater community to help them with something. The community can ask for something in return, or nothing at all.
