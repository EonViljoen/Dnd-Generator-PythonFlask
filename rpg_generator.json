Target is for a player to do something to a stone, then next player repeats and adds something, then next... (ex. Player 1 pats the stone, Player 2 pats the stone then stands on it, Player 3 pats it, stands on it, and puts a ration on it, etc.) Once each player has added 2 'moves' and the last one plays the whole chosen sequence, it opens. This can be done via irl rp.",

Three enigmatic pillars about 1 foot tall sit atop a small ledge, with a series of (d4 + 2) disks stacked on the one furthest to the left. The disks decrease in size as you reach the top of the stack. You must move the disks to the furthest pillar by moving a single disk to any pillar. You may not place a larger disk above a smaller disk.",

If pressed repeatedly, perceptive characters will start hearing a scraping noise of opening and closing, as a hint that it's working unseen.",

You can give strength checks to throw them off and make it seem like they are too weak. Solution: the door doesn't swing in or out, it raises up and down from the floor. Investigation to find out. Simple strength to actually push it down.",
        "A stone door with a hole about the size of a pen. 20ft. away, there is another stone stuck in the ground with its own pen sized hole.

The small key unlocks half the door; the big thick door splits apart to reveal it is two doors with a mirror sandwiched between the layers. The magic mirror can be stepped through and leads to a secret location. Smashing the door breaks the mirror and makes it unusable.

        "A room that's not fully visible from the entrance (L-shaped, T-shaped, whatever) and if you enter the room you can clearly hear the sound of a shutting door (GM's choice if there is another non-hidden door in the room). The Trick: the whole floor is a clever crafted pressure plate which shuts the secret door so you have either to fly, do some acrobatic rope play or climb over the furnishing in a kind of \"the floor is lava\" as the furniture stands on \"safe spots\". Once closed the secret doors only opens again after nothing stands on the plate and all non-hidden doors are closed from outside.",

On the other side is the exact copy of the room and a shapeshifting guardian who mimics the group(maybe best would be some kind of liquid golem so he can even mimic a whole group or put more guardians in the room). this may be noticed by small mistakes of the copies or their movement. After the group gets in the second room you also have a good mid-bossfight. Optional: If you have a aggressive group you can hide acid traps behind the wrong mirrors to prevent that they just smash their way through this puzzle.",

        "An ancient stone portal bears a number of glowing symbols on the face. The symbols are incomplete math equations, which need to be completed to open the door. The now-lost species that made the door treasured mathematical skill, seeing it as a literal gift from the gods; being correct in your math was seen as being correct in all things. The more important/dangerous the door, the more difficult the equation is to finish (since clearly a person who can do math that advanced can be trusted with the contents), on top of the difficulty of interpreting numeric and mathematical symbols not written by a living hand in 7 centuries.",
        "Through the right nostril of a large head statue.",

        "Room visually only has one entrance/exit, no doors. Walls are marked with a script (whatever language you want) that just says \"WALL\", the floor says \"FLOOR\", the ceiling says \"CEILING\". Drawing a door on a wall does nothing; drawing a door on a wall and writing \"DOOR\" automatically opens the drawn door to a safe room (or treasure room, or \"next\" room, whatever room you wanted it to be).",
        "A large balance scale rests in the middle of the room. Between two large golden pans, there is a traditionally-garbed wizard statue connected to the scale's bar at it's center. One side of the scale touches the floor with only a feather weighing down the large golden pan. Nonmagical items have no weight on the scale and only magical items can cause the scale to rise/fall. In some foreign language, the words \"Enchanter's Judgement\" is carved into the statue. The feather is a magical item (casts featherfall maybe?). Balancing the scale (take off the feather, put a magical item of equal value) opens one passage; outweighing the scale opens up the same passage as well as another (an alcove or treasure trove).",
        "The obvious doorway is a red herring, and is nailed shut. The mortar on the adjacent wall dissolves upon contact with water, and removing the bricks reveals the true passage.",
        "A large tomb with two dials with symbols that need to be aligned correctly. Selecting the symbols for \"After\" and \"Life\" opens the tomb and a false bottom leads to a staircase.",
        "A plain wall has a sign that reads: \"shake hands, and be welcome\". Nearby there is a statue ... but it's old, and has lost both arms. Except it hasn't. It's an illusion hiding the non-broken statue. Shake hands with it, and an open door is revealed in the wall.",
        "There is a door, alright, but it has no handle an no magic seems to work on it. It's right there, on that wall. On both sides of the door there's a lot of lit torches. Man, they're bright! This is the Door of Shadows. It will only open when shadows are cast upon it. What's behind such a door? Only one way to find out",
        "A fountain in the shape of an agony struck face of an old, scary man. The fountain water makes it look as if the male face is crying. If you tell the fountain a joke (successful perform-action) the water stops and the face is re-assembled with the mouth opening wide, the beard hair shifting where the eyebrows were and vice-versa so that it now looks like a person whose agony stems from barely being able to breathe laughing. Enter the mouth to get into the secret room.",

        "The ol' \"pulled book on a shelf leads to hidden entrance\", but different books port to different areas/chambers/rooms. Or better yet, the book is removable and the holster (from whence the book was removed) is reloadable--forcing the players to find \"the right book\" to get to their destination.",
        "Some number of chairs (3, if you want Easy mode) sit in a circle in a room. They all look different, but in slightly varying ways. Sit in the right one, and the hidden passage opens; but there is a Wrong Chair (or \"Punishment Chair\") that either opens up a passage to enemies, or initiates a trap.",

      "Deadly Traps" : [
        "A pit trap opens up beneath a character. At the bottom of the bit they are falling into is a button that drops a stone block on top of them, covering the hole and smashing the character.",
        "A lever with a sign that says \"Pull to open\" next to a locked door with an extremely poorly hid trap door right under the entrance. Pulling the lever surprisingly opens the door. If you touch the door without pulling the lever, the trap door opens.",
        "A series of regal-looking interconnected hallways are dimly lit with magical torches suspended in sconces. The entrance that the intruders come through suddenly closes itself off, and the intruders sit in silence for a few seconds. Looking down one of the other hallways reveals a slowly encroaching patch of darkness that snuffs out the torches as it makes its way forward, which relight themselves when intruders approach them while the darkness is not nearby. The intruders must search the various corridors while simultaneously avoiding the patch of darkness, which envelops and leaves no trace of anything that enters it. Any attempts to do combat with the darkness prove ineffectual, as anything that enters vanishes, never to be seen again. The darkness is semi-sentient, and the intruders can interact with it by trying to hide from it or get it to follow them. The key to escaping the hallways lies with the magic torches in the two impressively decorated sconces that the darkness can't seem to pass by. By removing one of the special torches and carrying it with them, an intruder can hold off the darkness or even push it back. However, confronting it for too long will begin to dim the torch until it eventually snuffs out, forcing the holder to escape the darkness in order for the torch to relight. When the special torches approach the darkness from both sides of a hallway, it condenses and eventually fades, leaving a shadowy door to the outside where the last of it vanished.",
        "A roughly cut gemstone hovers ominously over a crude alter in a cavernlike room while a malicious spirit floats up around the ceiling and out of sight. New entities entering the room causes the crystal turn to face the intruders, revealing that it is actually an eye of some sort, containing a pupil that darts rapidly between the intruders and the spirit. The spirit immediately begins cajoling the crystal eye into destroying the intruders, talking to it as though it were a child in need of guidance. After a few seconds of apparent listening, the eye completely focuses on the spirit and pillars of rock begin to rapidly erupt from the room's surfaces at points near the intruders. The pillars, while initially inaccurate, begin homing in on the intruders more and more the longer they stay still, and do 5d10 bludgeoning damage on a hit. The key to escaping the room is the crystal eye in the center of the room, which is being told by the spirit to kill the intruders. By being more persuasive than the spirit, intruders can convince the eye to stop its onslaught and eventually target the spirit instead, which will disperse after being hit multiple times with pillars of rock. The eye is very childlike in its considerations and will lose focus if the intruders fail to convince it or begin to act too impatient. Simplistic approaches work well, and the eye responds positively to constructive encouragement when it targets the intruders (That was some very good aiming, I could feel the wind rush by me! Next time though, try to aim towards the mean spirit instead, OK?). Once the spirit is destroyed, a gentle suggestion that the eye create an exit will convince it to pull a slab of rock away from a wall and reveal a passage to outside the room.",
        "Walking through an area with \"Dormant hives of bees,\" there is a queen bee figurine with a stinger shaped like a key in a glass jar at the opening of a room. The jar acts as a seal to keep the pheromones of the queen away from the rest of her hive. Once removed from the jar to unlock a mysterious key hole, the once dormant hives awaken to attack whomsoever holds \"their queen.\"",

        "A hallway with what appear to be dart traps, or falling spike traps, or fire. There are several different hallways in a succession of 3 (so imagine three hallways one after the other with different traps, with a small room between each that could hold 4-6 people. Each hallway starts with 2 statues. The first hallway deactivates the traps by grasping one of the hands and turning it down. Once the next hallway both statues have hands that turn, and one activates the traps just cleared while the other deactivates the ones ahead (but both can't happen so if the try to deactivate the traps ahead it will still be active). And finally the last hallway will deactivate the traps but the floor is pressure sensitive. Illustrate this by having the party see the hand start to turn back when a member starts to walk across. Essentially the first two hallways punish groups that don't follow right behind the rogue and send him forward to handle traps, while the last hallway punishes players who just follow right behind the rogue, and are afraid to make any distance.",
        "A map is found on a skeleton wrapped around an old skeleton key. The map shows traps, but all the information is either half right or all wrong.

        "A secret door that leads into a closet-sized chamber whose walls and door are very thick. Detect magic will reveal a faint aura where the walls meet the ceiling. If any character steps entirely inside and the door is not blocked, the door will shut and meld into the stone of the wall. There is a barrier of inch-thick adamantium within the stone of the walls/floor/ceiling: this must be dealt with in addition to two feet of stone. The character inside the chamber will begin to suffocate after one hour and takes one level of exhaustion after each additional hour.",
        "Walking down a hallway, the party passes through a large set of wooden reinforced doors. Beyond these doors is another hallway about 50ft long. In this hallway, there are 10 large sets of full steel armor with varying weapons from daggers, long swords, flails, whips, mauls, glaives etc (all of which are very well made). They're lined up along the walls of the hallway 5 on each side. If any of the armor or weapons are touched. Every single set of armor will come alive equipping the weapons they had, attacking the closest target immediately. The doors will also be slammed shut, slamming into anything in it?s way. The doors will only unlock if the sets of armor have been killed.",
        "You enter a dungeon with an open pit in the middle of the floor, runes that you can?t decipher are around the hole. As you approach you can hear the cries of a small child, and when you look into the pit you can see a human child covered in dirty rags. You?re able to get the child out, but they say they can?t cross the runes and you?ll have to lift them up and over them. When you do, the child (vampire) tries to feed from you, dealing piercing damage.",
        "You come to the end of a hallway with three doors, each with a word in Common written on them. The first door has Community, the second door has Feast, and the third door has Companion. If you open the first door a swarm of cranium rats will descend upon you, alerting you to a mindflayers? presence. If you open the second door three Spawn of Kyuss embrace you. If you open the third door, two Shadow Mastiffs lunge at you.",
        "A trap that is very kobold related, but could work for other creatures is this? Walking along a cliff either in a mountain/volcano or on it, a party member hits a pressure pad beneath some rubble, or dirt (depends on the environment). A harpoon shoots out and gets the member in the leg. A kobold who was waiting kicks a weight attached to a chain out and it drags the member down the side of the cliff to about 20ft above the next level (assuming they don?t pass a strength check at disadvantage). The ambush comes and there are kobolds on the lower level trying to reach the member while the party is ambushed and distracted. They will have to decide who is saving their friend and who is fighting, while the member is dangling and until he gets himself right side up is at a disadvantage to all attacks. The weight unless removed from the chain is going to disadvantage his climb (and the pain from a hook in his leg will make the climb a bit more difficult too). For ideas on how the chain looks, think of a fishing hook with a weight on it.",

        "A door that opens into a short hall, behind the door is a poorly hidden log tied to the ceiling, but opening the door didn?t cause it to swing, must be a dud. Touching the door on the other side causes the stone slab that was the floor to slide into the wall, causing the player to fall into a pit of brambles, and the false log trap detaches and falls on top of them. Can be solved by throwing a rock at the door on the other side, the log will fall and create a safe bridge across the brambles.",

Once the trap is triggered, gravity inverts in the room, dropping the occupants up into the spike trap chandelier. Afterwards, gravity returns to normal and drops them back down the room into the ground, followed shortly thereafter by the Impaldelier.",
        "A large square room, a small maze-like pathway in between pressure plates is on the the floor and leads to the other size.

        "In a narrow hallway, you have a part of the floor that folds down when to much weight is put on and springs back to its normal position once the weight has been dropped.

The walls of the well have small holes all along its length, possibly from climbing pitons. Once a certain amount of weight is applied to the rope (equivalent to two or three party members) a gelatinous cube is poured from its cell behind the stones in the wall, and seeps through the walls into the well above the players. The gelatinous cube paralyzes creatures when they touch it and fail a save. The cube happily slides down the well and consumes its prey until all organic material is digested, then it seeps through the grate at the bottom and it collected and replaced in its cell behind the stonework.",
        "A treasure chest in a 10' square pit. The entire pit is clean and smooth stone, making it difficult to climb. If weight is added to the floor of the pit (set to the weight of one or more humanoid adventurers) the pit and 1 foot of the pit walls is shot upward to the ceiling cutting off all means of escape. The walls then close in and collapse all humanoids unless they pile on top of the chest, which is not crushed. The treasure chest is a mimic but is magically paralyzed until the walls fully collapse inward, at which point he mimic is released from its spell and the trap resets in 1d4 days.",

        "A seemingly normal abandoned bathroom. There is a tripwire coming out of one of the stalls, that tightly seals the only door. Then, contaminated water starts coming out of the toilets. The adventurers must break the door to escape, and if they touch the water, they get sick.",
        "A bedroom with enough beds for the party to sleep on. There are pressure plates under the mattresses, that open small holes in the walls. Slowly but surely, a neurotoxin starts coming out of the holes, and seamlessly fills the room, while the adventurers sleep.",
        "A rickety wooden bridge over a big dark pit, with snakes on the bottom. There is a hole on one of the side walls (requiring a passive perception check to notice). The bridge itself is relatively safe, but there is a thin tripwire halfway through it, that activates the hole, making it spill out a line of fire over the end of the bridge.",
        "A wall with three stone doors. There is a paper on it, saying that two of the doors lead to a treasure, while another kills whoever is passing through. Going through those doors is not necessary for the adventure. If a player decides to try their luck, roll a d6 to see what happens.",

They have to shake the hands of every gargoyle before leaving the room, otherwise they will attack the party.",
        "This is a standard pit-trap with a twist. At the bottom of the pit, and for ten feet up the walls, everything is coated in pitch. Pitch may be sticky, but in quantity it also acts like any other oil-based liquid ? a lubricant. Climbing up a rope becomes extremely unlikely for whoever fell down the hole. But that?s not the worst bit. A couple of rounds after the pit trap is activated, the Kobolds, warned by a bell attached to the pit trap?s trigger, will show up with lit torches. And one of them will start combat by throwing a torch into the pit ? igniting the pitch!",
        "Oil floats on water: You all know the scene. In the middle of the vast dungeon is a lake. At one edge of the lake is a boat. The heroes have to pile into the boat and row across the lake to the next section of the dungeon. Well, this particular lake is guarded by kobolds with spyglasses. And a few barrels full of lamp oil. And a torch. Be sure to wait until the party is most of the way across the lake before the kobolds start pouring lamp oil on the water.",
        "Kobolds are light, and armor is heavy: A well prepared Kobold always has an escape route. And his escape route is generally one only a Kobold can use. While most Kobolds choose to make tight passages that only a Tiny creature can squeeze into (thanks to their ability to fit into unlikely places), some rely on the fact that their pursuers are generally heavier, and in larger numbers, than themselves. Choose a corridor, and undermine it (dig a tunnel under the floor, but with too little material acting as floor/ceiling). Leave it just enough strength to handle the weight of a Kobold or two. Fill the corridor below with something nasty, and have it lead somewhere nasty. As a finishing touch, make sure there?s a collapsing ceiling in the upper tunnel as well to ensure that the heroes can?t climb back out after you.",
        "Gold melts at a surprisingly low temperature: Did you know that you can melt gold in a candle flame? It would probably take about an hour to do so from room temperature, but you can. More importantly, if you keep your gold coins at a hot enough temperature, they?ll melt very quickly if exposed to a very potent heat source ? like say they might melt within seconds if they were doused in lamp oil and lit. This is an interesting thing to note if your chosen method of storing gold coins is in a wire-mesh cage attached to the ceiling. Especially if such a cage is kept at very high temperature, and is trapped with various kinds of flame traps (flame traps that trigger onto the gold). Unfortunately, while the temperature might be relatively high compared to the meltin point of most metal, it?s still more than enough to cook any flesh it comes in contact with (and STICK to that flesh, as molten metal tends to, causing the WORST sort of burns). And of course, the easiest way to get at the gold itself is from directly below it. Be sure to note to the party how hot it is in the room with the gold while they?re standing under it. If they?re clever enough to figure out the trap beforehand, hopefully they?re also clever enough to notice the hidden drains in the floor before all that molten gold runs (very, very quickly) down those drains.",

It?s important that the PC?s don?t get a chance to detect this trap or they?ll quickly find a solution (Search DC30). The character is teleported to a sealed tomb filled with the skeletons of various victims. A black pudding, CR equal to the party, attempts to engulf the teleported PC and turn him into a skeleton with its acid. When the trap goes off, one of these skeletons is instantly teleported to where the PC was standing, making it appear like he was disintegrated. Make a Search DC 25 to notice the skeleton (pile of bones) is not the same makeup as the PC (DC 20 if the size category of the PC is one larger or smaller than medium). After six teleportations, the \"living\" victims (or their remains) are teleported back to the trap area.

The river is causing the stone to rotate but it is caught in place by an outcrop of rock. As the river rotates the stone disc the disc grinds out more of the rock it has caught on. It has clearly been here for years as the stone it is stuck on has a sizable divot formed from the rotation.",

The caps are wide, some spanning to 5 feet, and each one is populated by an ecosystem of bioluminescent bugs. The stalks reach up overhead 10 to 20 feet high, but the diameter of the stalk is merely a few inches. Damaging any of these mushroom stalks causes them to collapse under their own fragility.",

After several minutes of struggling you come upon a clearing where several hammers and cracked stones are laid out on a blanket. Each round stone is a geode, able to be cracked with the hammer. They are beautiful, but cumbersome.",

As the trail moves down, the stones raise up, towering far overhead yet still close enough to touch. At the nadir of the path a wooden bridge zigzags through two massive mossy stones.

After a few minutes or so of this lush tunnel it opens up into what appears to be a clearing with a single wooden gazebo at the center, covered in flowers in full bloom. Benches all around the gazebo have been placed to support a large audience. The cavern overhead is cracked, and light streams in.",

A pair of huge hands, tented together to form a house, or shelter, with some camping amenities below.",
        "The trail becomes unnaturally dark, and rushing water can be heard. With meager light you can see that it curves past a waterfall before cutting up through the stone. Right before the staircase begins the stone landing has been carved into a viewing point for the falls, with dwarven cut banisters, but your light can only illuminate a fraction of the view.",
        "Though the path continues to the left, a wide cavern to the right has caved in, leaving a massive circle of light from the surface down. Roots and mosses drip down into the hole, and the floor of the cavern slowly slopes upward, covered in wild plants and fluttering with birds. A small branching trail leads towards the overgrown cave-in. Along this trail, tall thin grave markers have been placed.",
        "The path through an open cavern approaches a pond. The pond is perfectly square around the outside, and the path moves over the pond, on a series of rough laid stones covered in mosses, in a curved pattern. Branching off the path at regular intervals are tight spirals of stone. The pond is smooth and several glowing Koi fish can be seen swimming in the clear water.",
        "The tunnel opens up into a low, wide cavern, and a strong wind blows through here at odd intervals. On the ceiling, what appear to be naturally formed stone columns have been hollowed out by hand to different depths. The result; when the wind blows through the cavern a deep, haunting drone is made be the ceiling itself.",
        "The ground is wet and muddy with dripping water. As you continue on you come upon a deck of cards that has been scattered, some cards in the trail, some in cracks in the stone, some half buried, but all of them are clean and pristine. If the party manages to gather all the cards, they immediately rescatter from the holder's hand, all over the cavern once again.",
        "A single tree far off in the middle of a huge dark cavern, shimmers with refracted light. On closer inspection the whole tree appears to have been carved from a massive deep blue tourmaline.",
        "Someone has put down mile markers along the trail, big slabs of local stone with carefully carved dwarven numbers. They are not evenly spaced though, and don't seem to accurately reflect distance at all.",
        "A statue of an angel with a large stone sword stands in an alcove to the right of the trail. Several small pouches have been laid at its feet.",
        "From the ceiling a massive root has broken through the solid stone, leaving fissures and cracks as it reaches down. At the same place, from the floor, a root has broken upwards to the same effect. The roots have curled and spiraled around one another in the middle, interrupting the path. They appear to be from different species of tree.",
        "The tunnel path has run into a low, calm creek with a bottom of smooth flat stone. The water is only about calf-high. Walking in the water is soothing and invigorating. However every so often the creek bed is marred with deep (20+ yard) stone holes, perfectly circular.",
        "At the center of this cavern, lit from below by a series of bioluminescent ferns, is a stone sphere. The sphere is of different material than the surrounding stone. Additionally, the inside of the stone has been carved out, a set of stairs leads up into the center, where a raised altar has been carved, then another set of stone stairs leads out of the sphere.",
        "The trail opens up into a wide cavern dimly lit by glowing spheres. The pathway enters into the beginning of a maze. Through the maze can still be followed it looks like someone or something has simply obliterated a straight line right to the other side.",
        "The cavern is immensely tall, easily 100 feet high or more. At the top of this massive cavern wall you can clearly see a single window, lit from the inside. After looking for a while, the light goes out and the window disappears.",
        "Someone has placed massive glowing spheres merged with the stone and stalactites nearby. The spheres glow a blue-green and range from one foot to 4 feet in diameter. Some are high up in stone outcrops on the ceiling, some tucked the worn stone path below.",
        "In the wide cavern with a rushing underground stream something vaguely humanoid catches your eye, just for a moment. It is deep beyond the trail but, moving your head slightly, you can just barely make the outline of a person. If the party inspects further they will find a human sized sculpture made entirely of a mirrored surface, to reflect the cavern around them.",
        "The tunnel opens into a huge cavern full of massive trees. Broken pottery scatters the ground. Pieces of broken flower pots lay all around the roots of the trees here, giving the sense that these trees burst out of their former containers rather quickly.",
        "From far off you can hear the sound of falling water. Light up ahead seems to betray and exit to the cavern, but as you arrive you see that a waterfall has cut through the ceiling, and again through the floor. Peering down, you can see that the waterfall has cut through many other tunnels below, and there is no clear way to the surface.",
        "The natural cavern opens out into a wide hallway, clearly carved from the surrounding stone long ago. The ceiling is now at least 50 feet overhead and massive pillars support it from below. Thin staircases cover the pillars and walls, leading to small alcoves.",
        "A band of bright lit stone forms overhead, lighting the tunnel. Someone has planted a row of rose bushes on either side of the tunnel, the roses are in full, brilliant bloom.",
        "The cavern that appeared to be naturally formed has shifted toward a man-made tunnel. The floor is flat, and the ceiling is a perfectly curved arch. Every foot or so the stone of the walls changes, from slate, or limestone, to moss agate, to obsidian, etc. Each stone section fits perfectly with those next to it.",
        "The cavern path dips down under the surface of a calm subterranean lake, it is easy to see it continue underwater and then reemerge on the other side of the lake. It looks like the only way across is to swim. The water's surface is not calm though, perhaps the ceiling is dripping and disturbing the dark water?",
        "The cavern here is made entirely of chalk. It wouldn't be hard to break off a chunk , and in fact it looks like several adventurers before you have done just that. In the tunnels beyond, chalk graffiti is quite common.",
        "Ahead you can see odd crystal formations in the tunnel, they are flat and wide, and reach down from the tunnel ceiling, but none jut up from the floor. The floor remains flat and clear. The crystals force the tunnel to shrink, making the party proceed in single file. In places the crystals come down quite far, and elsewhere they are at least 30 feet overhead. Upon close inspection, or if anyone touches the 'crystals' they will realize these are not crystals at all, but pieces of glistening fabric. This was never a tunnel at all, but a wide cavern, completely packed with these hanging strips of fabric.",
        "The cave opens into a subterranean room, carved out intentionally, but not cleanly ? it is irregular in shape and through the floor is flat the walls and ceiling are not. There is nothing in this room except for a 20' circular raised platform bearing a wide array of mosses.",
        "A large red clay pot has been placed on its side at the top of a nearby underground spring. The back of the pot has been removed to let water flow in, changing the water's course to flow out of the mouth of the pot, giving the effect of constant pouring.",
        "In the nearby stone and crystal pillars, naturally formed, are various carvings. Some are plants and trees, some are animals and fish. Each carving is done expertly. In the middle of a large group of carved plants is a carving of a person whose joints appear to be that of a mechanical doll's. It's face is a plain featureless mask.",
        "A geyser erupts every few minutes along the pathside in this cave. It strikes the low ceiling, just as it has been for hundreds of years. A sizeable hole has formed in the stone above where the water strikes, and now, when the water strikes the top, the hole forces the water to flow down in a domed shape. The water is hot, but not scalding.",
        "The trail passes through a low, wide cavern which is full of water. Floating on the water's surface are thousands of large blooming flowers. At the base of each blossom a silver ring fits snugly. Removing the ring causes the blossom to wither and die. You must wade through the flowering lake to continue on the path.",
        "Ahead the stone tunnel trail gives way down a steep cliff with a descending staircase. Along the way, several man-made turquoise pools of water cascade down into one another from a local spring. The pools each feed into one another and have a submerged bench to seat between 5 and 10. No other people can be seen.",
        "You began noticing a few spider webs catching drips of water from the ceiling. The webbing becomes more and more common and as it does, the strands shimmer with iridescent color. After a while thick and heavy opal strands drape over the trail like blankets. Eventually the webbing fades like it appeared, and the trail is clear again. The next time you inspect your pack, you find a 30' coil of strong silken rope.",
        "The trail passes by a pocket cavern off the main tunnel with a circle statues of delvers in poses of laughter, trade, or rest. All of them appear happy. Each one has a real backpack, though some are rotting off. Many of the backpacks contain small offerings, perhaps left by passing adventurers?",
        "The natural tunnel is bisected by a subterranean ice flow. Some time ago, perhaps years, the ice was carved through by some adventurer to continue on to the rest of the tunnel, but the slow moving ice has pushed that tunnel down-flow. The entrance of the tunnel is no more than a foot and a half wide, and will need to be cut to accommodate anyone larger. The ice tunnel beyond is spacious, but the exit, once again, is tight.",
        "The tunnel passes through an immensely tall skinny hole, leading towards daylight. Bats cover the ceiling, squeaking and fluttering around. Peering outside you see this rift is at least 100 feet up the side of a sheer cliff, overlooking jungle.",
        "You happen across a long bridge spanning a chasm. Glancing to the northeast you see another bridge, made of a massive stone slab, overgrown with moss. A procession of drow crosses the bridge in silence. When they reach the other side you can no longer see them.",
        "You hear the sound of distant creaking. Perception check to spot, deep in the dark cavern, a structure. Far off the trail is a calcified sailing ship, sails heavy with water. There is a large hole in the hull. Stalagmites have formed on the ships surface and a wet algae has grown across everything.",
        "Calcium deposits are prevalent in this cavern, but up ahead an old stalagmite and stalactite have met in the middle of the tunnel. Just before touching someone has placed a smooth sphere of precious stone, and now the calcium has begun to form around the outside, holding it in place.",
        "A gigantic jawbone is arched over the trail, over the party's heads with room to spare. Glistening strings with blown glass stars have been hung from various points on the teeth.",
        "The tunnel floor comes upon a circular puddle full of dark water. Trying to touch the water reveals the 'puddle' is actually a very deep borehole reaching down 50 feet. At the bottom of this hole are several adventurer bones and any supplies not ruined by water.",
        "The trail passes by half a stone face carved from a boulder, Just this half of the face is taller than any party member. A mile down the trail, the other half of the face. Farther still, a hand holding a sword hilt and the broken fragments of sword. Then another hand holding onto a lantern the size of a small house, lit by some magical force. The stones around the lantern glow with a pulsating rhythm.",
        "While the cave wall to the left is rough and craggy, to the right the wall is smooth, bulging out slightly. As you continue the smooth wall changes pattern over the course of half a mile of perfectly straight cavern. By the end you have an idea of what it is and your theory is confirmed with you see the huge face. The 'wall' was a gigantic fallen statue of a person. The only exposed eye, larger than your whole body, appears to be hinged like a door. A small room can be found beyond.",
        "The trail passes by a circular mirror which is being held from behind by a statue. The Statue depicts a man in a cloak with an impossibly long neck and the face of a barn owl, peering over the top of the mirror and gazing at itself.",
        "Along the trail are spheres of iron, hollow on the inside about 2 feet in diameter. The iron shell has been cut out to show a forest scene made in metal, each sphere has a different scene. Someone has set a campfire inside each. The fire on the inside of the sculpture backlights the iron cutouts, and lights the tunnel.",
        "The tunnel is cut by a fissure in the stone, one foot across, and spanning into the stone an unknown distance. The fissure is well lit by a magma flow running down one side of the fissure and along the bottom, but the magma is at least 10 yards away from the tunnel and poses no risk. The heat causes strong winds to blow through this fissure and through the tunnel. The jump across is easy.",
        "The entire tunnel has two fissures running along it, horizontally. This causes one whole layer, or strata, to be offset from the other walls by a foot. It appears as though a portion of the stone was simply pushed out of alignment.",
        "A sculpture of a giant metal key leans against a plain wall. It is labeled ?Important?",
        "In an expansive cave on either side of the trail Two massive stone wings have been placed, reaching toward a vein of black stone in the ceiling.",
        "A massive circle of obsidian, about 20 feet across, has been placed in an alcove just off the trail. It is elevated off the ground about 2 feet, held up by carved stone legs. Condensing moisture in the air has filled the slightly concave surface with perfectly smooth reflective water. After looking for a moment, a drop of water falls, disturbing the smooth surface.",
        "Rather than building a bridge over the top of this subterranean stream, someone has tunneled underneath. Inside the tunnel is lit by a cluster of luminescent moths.",
        "This stretch of tunnel is scorched, as though a fire has recently passed through. In fact, a few burning embers and hot stones can still be found. The mosses here are still smoking. Interestingly the smoke of the mosses is pleasant, like incense, and fills the cavern with flowery smoke.",
        "Several animal skulls are piled along the tunnel. Each one has been delicately carved with an intricate pattern, without losing the structural integrity of the skulls.",
        "At a bend in the trail, just off to the right, someone has placed a perfectly smooth cylinder of white marble, 7 feet tall. Walking around to the back of the cylinder reveals a highly detailed face has been carved into a deep crack in the marble.",
        "A massive illusionary koi fish swims through this cavern. Every so often it dips down to pass right through the party. Each time it does, the air smells of fresh mint.",
        "Someone has taken the heads of old broken shovels and attached them at the base to make a huge metal pine cone. Then they placed smack in the middle of this tunnel, for some reason.",
        "At first you think perhaps someone has spilled a bag of coins, but you realize that the scattered coins get more and more dense, almost like a mosaic. For about 10 yards the trail is perfectly paved with coins before the trail peters out again. The coins here appear to be from all different regions, in small denominations. Should you leave some coins to further the trail too?",
        "Through the dark cavern you can hear the sound of ocean waves, and begin to smell salt air. Rounding a corner, you can feel sand underfoot. Inside this pitch black cave the ocean laps at the shore.",
        "A stray dog wanders up to you on the trail and decides to walk with you. He has a red bandana tied around his neck. After about a mile or so he wanders off again, down a branching fork in the tunnel.",
        "The trail has become a stone hopscotch board.",
        "Passing by a wide stream you spy a cat walking into the water. To your shock the water arcs around the cat, keeping it perfectly dry. With a deft swipe the cat snatches a fish from the water wall in front of it, and leaves the stream, still dry, now fed.",
        "Ahead you can hear the clink and jangle of falling pebbles. Rounding a bend in the trail, a cascade of smooth beach glass pours from a fissure in the wall, flows over the path, and continues on down another crack in the wall.",
        "The cavern walls have fossil imprints regularly. Among the fossils you may find; a giant dragonfly wing, 10 feet long. A series of tiny hand bones. The complete skeleton of a large lizard like creature with huge horns. Several hard-shelled beetles, a up to a foot in size. The ?bones? of a porcelain mechanical doll, with a mask in the place of the head. One stone crack is filled with spiraling ridged shell fossils.",
        "The path opens up into a carved out grotto where several gigantic metal rings support celestial sculptures. The Sun and Moon are represented by colorful and bright spheres carved to resemble the faces of two women. Other planets and important stars have their own rings. It appears that the rings move in time with the celestial bodies, accurately depicting their position from the perspective of someone at the center of the sculpture.",
        "The tunnel slopes downward before ending in a hole, about 10 feet across. Several sturdy metal hooks are in place and at least one already has a rope attached, though the durability of the old rope is questionable. Peering through the hole, you can see the roof of a sizeable castle, with towers reaching up to just under the hole, it would be risky to jump, but plausible. Through other holes in this cavern ceiling waterfalls pour into the castle. The sturdy stonework of the castle has resulted in flooding from the waterfalls. Each room holds a few inches to several feet of water. One windowless tower door was so well made that the full tower was flooded, and now water cascades from the top down the stonework and into the courtyard. Water cascades down the grand staircase to the entrance. The courtyard, surrounded by a low circular wall, is now an algae filled pond, full of cave fish. Outside this castle pond, overflow rivers converge and continue on into the cave."

        "Two bronze heads with open mouths, a deer and a wolf, with a door between them. To unlock the door you must put some meat in the wolf's mouth and some vegetable matter in the deer's mouth. Putting anything else in will cause the heads to howl and shriek, attracting a wandering monster.",
        "Floor covered in piles of hibernating murderferrets. Loud noises and being stepped on will awaken and enrage them. Murderferrets will prefer to attack things which other murderferrets have already latched on to. Tread carefully.",
        "Pile of precariously stacked coins. Taking some risks being crushed under the rest's weight.",
        "Rift in floor over key ley line intersection, glowing od flows out of it. Harmless to living things, inanimate objects passing through it are animated, might desire revenge against their users or be loyal depending on mistreatment and care.",
        "Valuable, slightly worm-eaten books. If sold to collector without cleaning the worms will spread to their library and the collector will hire thugs to assault the party as vengeance.",
        "Glass case filled with potions. Breaking the glass will cause a guard golem to attack. Trying to tip out a potion might shatter the potion or crush the tipper under the case. Putting tokens found elsewhere in the dungeon into a slot on the case will release a single potion.",
        "Hallway is throat of hungry creature. The floor is a tongue. If anything tasty touches the floor, everything in the hallway is swallowed. If anything gross touches the floor, everything in the hallway is bathed in corrosive bile. Neutral and flavourless things cause no reaction.",
        "Dungeon is haunted by courtesy-spirit. Politeness and respect are required. Crudeness, dirtiness, and fighting outside the context of a formal duel are punished.",
        "Getting to key part of dungeon requires wading through pool of napalm. Burning out the pool would take many hours, and fill the place with smoke. Napalm is sticky, hard to remove, very flammable.",
        "Pit of spikes. Spikes are rusted to the core, crumble at slightest touch. Still a tetanus risk.",
        "Slickly oiled staircase. At their bottom lies a fallen adventurer with a broken neck.",
        "Snickering goblin challenges you to game of dice, with your soul as the wager. Offers location of buried treasures if you win. Cheats constantly, denies it if caught, dice are oddly shaped beetles trained to give preferred results.",
        "Once entered, dungeon begins slow, inexorable process of shrinking. Get in and out before it you're too big to get through the doors.",
        "Wall of green fire around goblin camp. Anyone accompanied by a goblin while passing through takes no damage. For every goblin you've killed in the dungeon so far, take a bit more damage.",
        "Camera flash blinds you for a few minutes when you open door/chest/etc. Your picture is distributed to many doppelg?ngers and mimics, who wreak havoc with your identity.",
        "Room with crank-operated rotating saw blades on floor and a swarm of hellbirds flapping around. A goblin on a catwalk in the room is under orders to turn the crank when intruders enter the room. The goblin is difficult to get to or target, but its arms are tired, and it is hungry and easily bribed.",
        "Room is filled with invisible hallucinogenic gas and cult idols/treasure. The longer spent in the room, the more the idols take on terrifying hallucinatory reality.",
        "A cubic room with a door on each wall, on the floor, and on the sealing, with a six-sided dial beside each. One dial setting will lead you back where you came, one will lead to the way progressing through the dungeon, one leads to the door in the ceiling, the gravitational angle of which will make you fall through it, and the rest circle back to another door in the room.",
        "A dish of water next to an underwater section of the dungeon. If someone drinks from the dish they grow gills and start suffocating until they get into water. Somewhere in the underwater section is a trapped bubble of air which when inhaled will restore them to normal.",
        "Strange device. If touched will jab toucher with needle, draw blood, and rapidly grow clone-baby from their DNA. Find safe home for baby or leave your own infant-self to die.",
        "A pressure plate for a noisemaker-mine, which deafens everyone in the room for a few minutes and alerts everything in the dungeon to their presence and location.",
        "A room with a loamy floor. Planted in the floor are magic seeds. Should the loam the seeds are planted in get wet, they will immediately sprout into a tree, bludgeoning anyone standing near them when they do. Any liquid will cause this reaction, from water to spilled blood to potions.",
        "A lens which when looked through allows one to see hidden doors, passages, etc. in the dungeon, but using it also lets you see the insubstantial monsters lurking about, who consider being seen a grievous offense. The longer you look through the lens, the higher the risk they notice you looking.",
        "A statue next to a locked door. The statue has a gem for one eye, and the other is missing. Taking the gem releases a cloud of poison gas from the hollow in the statue's head. Replacing the missing eye with an object approximating its shape opens the door (assuming the gem eye hasn't been take out, as if it has it'll need to be replaced too).",
        "A door shaped like a serpent with its lips sewn shut by scorpions. It will open for someone who is currently poisoned. Pouring an antidote/antivenin on the door will cause it to corrode.",
        "What appears to be a room with a mirror along one wall is actually a room split by a window, mirrored on each side, with mimicking shapeshifters on the far side who match the party until they seize an opportunity for an ambush.",
        "A scoreboard somewhere in the dungeon awards and records points to adventurers for monsters killed, treasure found, etc. Every so often, the lowest performer gets electrocuted.",
        "A huge grub waiting in a pit under a bridge. When it eats meat, it gets a bit bigger and belches precious gems. After reaching a critical mass it metamorphoses into a flying creature that can escape the pit.",
        "A series of chairs with attached helmets. Sitting in a chair renders your body unconscious while your mind is projected into a random creature somewhere else in the dungeon. If the creature dies, so do you. The best way to return your mind to your body is to reunite the creature you're possessing with your body.",
        "A velvet rope winds through this section of the dungeon. Attempting to go over or under it without being sufficiently well-dressed or attractive will summon a bouncer demon to kick you out. Cutting the rope sends the demon into a blind frenzy.",
        "Pipes run along the length of this hallway. Valves on the pipes release scalding steam in a regular pattern. Someone paying close attention to the pattern could get through unscathed. Smashing through the pipes will release a huge cloud of steam and reduce visibility for everyone on this level of the dungeon, but stop the steam releases.",
        "A monkey statue with its hands over its eyes. Looking at the statue causes it to shudder. Looking for more than a few seconds causes it to animate and attack until it's destroyed or everyone present looks away for a few seconds. A hostile goblin is standing with its back to the statue.",
        "A patch of roiling, impenetrable darkness that reaches towards nearby lights. If it touches a light source, that light source is snuffed and converted to another patch of hungry darkness. Destroyed by sunlight, whether it's direct or reflected.",
        "A ladder with razors on every rung.",
        "Floor is carpeted with living, immobile skin of she-bear weeping piteously. If they avoid stepping on her or otherwise harming her while making their way across the room, she'll reward them with her magic healing milk.",
        "Round hallway with pile of powder on one end, one entrance on side, one entrance on other end. Hallway is actually giant cannon. Any spark or open flame risks firing it.",
        "Treasure on a pedestal. Treasure has coat of sovereign glue and is deceptively heavy.",
        "Some parts of the dungeon's walls/floors are one-way mirrors, or otherwise opaque in one direction and transparent from the other. Used by dungeon inhabitants for observation and ambushes.",
        "Goblin-spirit offers to lead you to treasure in other section of dungeon if you carry it there. Goblin-spirit becomes heavier the longer it's carried, obstinate about not letting go until the treasure is reached.",
        "Hallway with thin layer of dust on floor and many cunningly disguised pressure plates which trigger deadly traps. Trails of footprints are clear in the dust, some ending abruptly where they triggered a pressure plate. Explosions, gusts, and the like will disturb the footprints and make it more difficult to find a safe path.",
        "Glowing protagonite crystals embedded in walls of dungeon section emit radiation lethal to hirelings.",
        "Archer in dungeon shoots arrows with key-shaped heads. Key-arrows unlock doors in dungeon. Striking a hard surface like armour or a wall ruins the keys. Archer hides behind portcullis which can only be unlocked by on of their arrows.",
        "Bushes with cursed spiny dungeon fruit crowd key chokepoints, cling to clothes and hair. Anyone who's eaten a fruit or has one clinging to them cannot leave the dungeon until it's removed from their body.",
        "Rickety, faulty elevator allows quick movement between levels of dungeon, carries risk of dropping/rising too far and too fast.",
        "Large room contains labyrinth of invisible walls with razor-sharp edges.",
        "Beads spilled on floor, present tripping hazard.",
        "Fake pit trap, actually a painting with illusion of depth.",
        "Faltering portal connecting dungeon areas, opens and closes rapidly, closing portal severs anything caught in it.",
        "Hallway studded with holes in walls and ceiling, home to cave-eels, holes hiding eels revealed by dripping slobber, creature walking in front of eel-hole will be snatched and dragged to lair elsewhere in dungeon.",
        "Dungeon is built as movable mechanism but has grown unstable over time, sections of dungeon can be moved to reveal secret areas and connect distant sections, but each time raises risk of partial collapse.",
        "Buoyant treasure at bottom of deep pit, tunnel at top of pit has lever at end of it that releases flood of water into tunnel, leaving the flood on will lift the treasure but also eventually flood dungeon.",

        "Patch of healing fungus, healed wounds are colonized by the fungus, fungal colonies gradually spread over body until burned off.",
        "Thin curtain of numbing slime drips across passageway. When absorbed into skin prevents feeling pain and telling how bad wounds are.",
        "Series of pipes channels and amplifies cave-wind through enormous trumpet, noise produced is loud enough to burst blood vessels up close, can be heard from very far off.",
        "Treasure wrapped in frog-skin quilt, its colourful patches are poisonous but the dull patches are safe.",
        "Axes swinging across hallway are sentient and capable of speech. Each has a conflicting agenda with the others. Will let you pass if you please them, but something that pleases one may offend another.",
        "Closed door engraved with half of magic seal, other half on wall. Opening door breaks the seal and releases a ghost.",
        "Dungeon inhabited by ant-people, traps cunningly hidden to sight but detectable by scent markers, each sort of trap indicated by different scent.",
        "A large spherical gem shaped like an eye. Enchanted, has twin held by boss of dungeon. When held and looked into allows scrying the area around its twin. Boss will be aware if gem is picked up.",
        "Predatory reverse puffballs, seeds will drift towards air movement and take root in flesh.",
        "Dungeon is spatially folded/compressed in sections, held together by enchanted golden space-staples. Pulling them out causes dungeon dimensions to suddenly expand back to their original extent, to various effects.",
        "Dungeon is mounted on churning gears, careful when moving near them lest you be caught and crushed.",
        "Microwave coil in center of room rapidly boils water within the room (including water within bodies), unless that water is shielded/insulated in the direction of the coil.",
        "A room with a boiling cauldron giving off lighter-than-air toxic fumes. So long as the cauldron's boiling, anyone moving through the room will have to crawl or else risk inhaling the fumes.",
        "Lines of venomous ants crawl across room to and from food source. Will attack anyone breaking/crossing their lines. Will move their lines toward more appealing/sweeter food sources.",
        "Stable tornado in room pulls nearby things into it, buffers and flings them out a hole and to the surface.",

        "Dungeon is home to village of people growing strange crops, raising strange livestock. All claim to have lived there their entire lives, but many are starving for as their bodies can't digest these strange things well. Spending time in the dungeon will gradually replace your memories with ones of always having lived in the dungeon.",
        "Pressure plate near entryway of dungeon will release rockslide that blocks entrance. It would take several man-days to dig out. Another exit might be found deeper within.",
        "Walls in dungeon are thin and can be smashed through with a sledgehammer or similar method, but some are load-bearing walls and will cause a localized cave-in if smashed.",

Even a few crabs are no threat to a human, but enough of them might be. If you ignore them they'll go about their violent business and eventually one side will emerge victorious.

If you attack both sides they'll band together to fight you.",

        "A patch of reeds. The sand around it seems recently disturbed. Underneath, a squad of blue-skinned goblins waits for a chance ambush. Their rattling breaths can be heard from the reeds just over the sound of the breeze.",
        "A galley and its crew, resting ashore. They're looking for slaves to replace the ones who died at sea. They'll pay for prisoners, as well as tips about vulnerable populations, but may try to capture you if you give an impression of weakness. If released the slaves on the galley will split evenly between those who flee and those who try to kill the crew.",
        "A marooned man with salt-cracked lips, escaped from exile on a ramshackle raft. He's near death and deserved worse than marooning for what he did, but he also knows secrets you'll want.",
        "An explorer from a distant land. She's curious about the region and will report anything you tell her as truth back to her emperor, and in some months time when the full expeditionary fleet arrives they'll act off that information.",
        "The severed tentacle of a sea monster, still grasping on the dying reactions of its ganglionic brain. It will flop after the closest thing generating vibrations (besides the waves), such as by stepping on the sand, and try to crush it. Hard to take on in a straight fight, easy to trick.",
        "Someone's made an elaborate mandala in the sand. If you can step within it without disturbing its lines, you'll be blessed with peace of mind and rapid healing while they stay there. The mandala will be wiped away when the tide comes in.",
        "Off in the distance you can see an approaching black cloud, a buzzing noise rising as it nears. A swarm of sandflies in ravenous frenzy. Too many to fight. Flee, find shelter, or suffer a death of a million little bites.",
        "A flock of sirens competing in a singing contest. Passers-by will be pressed into judging the winner. Losers will be furious.",
        "You spot something shiny ahead: the handle of a sword jutting up from the sand. There's not much left beneath that hasn't rusted to powder. Inscribed on the blade is part of a poem in a language only scholars still speak, florid in its dedication of the sword to a young prince by their father, the king. The sword's enchantment is as broken as its blade. Where once its cut carried golden light that ate away at wounds, it now inflicts a contagious, blistering radiance.",
        "Assorted fish, bloated with eggs, pulled onto land by the parasites which have now grown larger than the fish's mouths which once held them. The parasites are here to nest, and will protect their broods with maternal ferocity.",
        "Some grumpy merfolk lounge a ways offshore. When they spot you they'll throw insults and rocks, but will disperse if the situation is escalated beyond that or if you can dish out a better insult than theirs'.",
        "Several serrated teeth scattered near a bleached, broken jaw. If thrown on the ground these teeth will sprout into fully-grown humanoid remora warriors loyal to whoever threw the teeth. They'll quickly suffocate on land.",
        "A woman overturns rocks in a panic. In the distance angry shouts can be heard. She's a selkie fleeing a wealthy merchant husband who forbid her from returning to the ocean, unable to find her skin. The husband has roused a mob to drag her back to their house and children. Not much time's left before the mob arrives.",
        "The sand here is a riot of many hues, stained by wild magic. Magic cast while standing on this sand works chaotically. Sleeping on it brings prophetic nightmares. Eating it is mutagenic. All of these properties are preserved even if the sand's removed from the beach.",
        "A boot sunk in to its ankle. It's within a wide patch of hard-to-distinguish quicksand blocking the path. The boot is of high quality, but otherwise unremarkable.",
        "A lighthouse, the light of which is an uncanny green. Its keeper is more than a little mad, and spends all day gathering fireflies and their grubs. At dusk the keeper places his daily catch in a fine-mesh cage at the lighthouse's top. Each night the fireflies feed on each other, becoming larger, brighter, and crueler. This will not end happily.",
        "A Mexican stand-off between three pirates, a recently-unburied chest full of booty in the middle of them.",
        "A worn-away wisp of a dryad, clinging to the driftwood which was once her tree. Will try to commit suicide-by-adventurer by convincing them she's more dangerous than she is to end her agony. If her bluff is called and she's shuffled gently off this mortal coil, the dryad's driftwood splits open to reveal a magic seed.",
        "A smuggler in a heavy cloak and a rowboat that seems too rotten to float. Direct light will reveal the smuggler's true, skeletal face. She discovered a treacherous route out of the underworld then decided to continue the profession she followed in life. The dead smuggler offers goods not found among the living, and attempts to rope you into her schemes.",
        "The sand in this section of beach is greyish-red, iron-like, magnetically anomalous. Carrying ferrous metal through it can kick up obscuring clouds and rasping sandstorms.",
        "A man in a suit of armour sitting on a stone. Not really a man at all, but a knight-crab (like a hermit crab, but bigger, more dangerous, and uses armour instead of shells to house its vulnerable parts) grown a bit too large for its current home and looking to upgrade. Will mimic human behaviour as well as a clever animal can to lure prey closer before it attacks.",
        "An idol of verdigrised bronze half-buried in the sand. Time and water have worn away its features to the point that you can't tell whether it was supposed to look angelic or demonic.",
        "Goblins racing wheels and wagons down the slope of the waterline. They won't let you pass unless you beat them at their own race. Materials for a vehicle will be provided, including: old planks, nails, an inflated pig skin, and very hard melons. Sabotage of other racers is not only allowed, it's encouraged.",
        "A sea-hag crouches in the water, combing tangles from her hair. She's self-serving, always hungry, and morbidly humourous, but willing to barter fresh flesh and magical objects for her services and charms. The hag will die if her hair ever dries out.",
        "A worn leather case containing a smeared and mildewed scroll bobs in the waves. The scroll contains a random spell, but the damage to the scroll will mess with its activation. Maybe it'll fizzle out, or affect a different target, or even become more powerful.",
        "A rusted machine. Its gears turn so slowly that the movement is nearly imperceptible, its ticking seeming perhaps to be your imagination. It will finally wind down in a matter of hours, and when it does it will explode. With tools (or fingers you don't mind getting pinched off) the gears can be manually re- or unwound. Immersing the machine in water will delay its detonation indefinitely.",
        "A shark-man brute leaps from the water, positioning itself so that dazzling, blinding light shines off the surface at its back and into your face. Tries to intimidate its way to a toll of wealth and rations, fights reluctantly.",
        "An unhinged wizard rants and raves against the ocean. He seeks allies against it, and will attack anyone who seems to be in league with it (e.g. by sailing upon it, eating its fish, etc.).",
        "Hungry beachworms tunnelling below, bulging the sand above their passage. They can't dig through solid rock, but are fast enough to overtake a running person. The sand above softens any blows against them except for when they lunge or watch periscope-like for prey.",
        "Galumphing kelp-freits wielding enormous shell-and-bone scissors. They work to separate the abominable in-betweens of land and sea: amphibians, sailors, seagulls, and so on, with the edge of their scissors if necessary (it's most often necessary). The kelp-freits try to set up flanks between themselves, so they can combine their scissors to gruesome amputative effect.",
        "A drunken giant building an equally giant sandcastle. It's dangerously oblivious in its scooping and molding, and if pestered will demand you act out its imaginings of what life in a castle is like with the frightened prisoners the giant's already captured.",
        "A big, stoic sandstone face carved into the side of a hill. It will open its mouth to the treasure stashed within only for the person it was carved to resemble. The enchantment on it is rather crude, so a mask painted to look like it, its reflection in a mirror, and the like would all be sufficient to fool the face into opening. Dynamite will also open the face, but risks damaging the treasure within.",
        "A discarded coffer full of cursed silver coins. If carried they'll tarnish any other precious metals you touch, and will return to your possession the night after you spend them. They'll appear in your mouth if you've got no bags or pockets for them.",
        "A group of young nobles play polo as their bodyguards watch on. They're growing bored with their game and eager for new amusements. They nobles unfamiliar with the possibility of their actions having negative consequences. Together their horses and jewelry are worth a small fortune to a discreet buyer who wouldn't sell you out to the nobles' parents.",
        "A decrepit yacht drifting down the shore. Its undead passengers believe themselves to still be alive and at an upscale party, dancing and drinking from dusty glasses. They'll get violent if anything disturbs this illusion, and start off assuming any unfamiliar faces are servants. Some durable valuables are still onboard.",
        "A storm tears through the area, coming and going in maelstromous moments. Soon after the storm passes, a party of fairies riding albatrosses swoop down and ask which direction their quarry went. If told honestly you'll wake up some days later with a bottle of lightning by your head. If they're lied to you'll find yourself caught in a deluge every time you try to sleep outside for the next month.",
        "A spattering of holes and the goblins digging them. They've got a waterlogged treasure map, the ink too smudged to read clearly, and are digging all over the approximate area of where \"X\" marked the spot.",
        "A collection of jars, some shattered, some whole, all caught in some muck. Within them is some goo. Drinking the goo inflicts a piscine mutation: gills, bulging eyes, legs fused into fins, skin turned to scales, and so on. Each jar's goo inflicts a single mutation.",
        "An estuary where crocodiles lurk.",
        "A basket bobbing in the sea foam. Within is a wailing baby, several items of golden jewelry, and a note. The note explains that the baby is the youngest son of a king, sent downriver to escape the murderous attention of the crown prince. It further implores its reader to raise the baby well, take the jewelry as payment (though leaving one piece as a keepsake), and some day tell them of their royal heritage and duty to overthrow their tyrannous sibling.",
        "An impromptu bazaar halfway in the water. Merchants from land and sea have gathered here to trade goods only found in their respective environs.",
        "A holy oil spill shimmering on top of the water. It'll still be potent if bottled. In the center of the spill a ghoul shivers atop a raft and cries for help.",
        "A crate of wax-sealed amphora full of wine that's soured to vinegar. One of the amphora, painted with sharks instead of dolphins, is packed with cocaine or something similar.",
        "The way down the beach here is craggy, with rough waters slamming rougher rocks hemming in one side and a sheer cliff the other. The crags ahead are home to giant barnacles, glued in place but able to lash out at intruders with their tremendous penises.",
        "Some fishermen gambling around a barbecue pit.",

        "A floating dock that trails out to a prime fishing spot.",
        "A fresh shipwreck. There's a three-way argument between some human scavengers, goblins, and fish-men as to how to split the spoils. They haven't come to blows yet, but they're close.",
        "A desiccated ocean chimera (eel for a tail, heads from a turtle, a pufferfish, and a seahorse, body like all four mashed together, breathes gouts of inky venom) placed above the high tide line. Contact with water will restore it instantly to lively hostility.",
        "A dire cormorant snacking on a splatter of dead fish washed ashore by a swell. Protective of its food but otherwise placid. Tameable.",

        "Colourful, frilly seaslug-men crowd around you and probe with soft appendages, babbling all the while. They're tourists from the undersea realms. Curious about you, but unable to speak your language, and assume their gesticulations are more comprehensible than they are. At the first sign of violence they'll vomit their guts out and crawl over each other to get back in the ocean.",

        "Gems ground to dust have been mixed into the sand here, glittering in ruby and sapphire hues. It'd be valuable but time consuming to sift it out here, but this risks attracting the attention of wandering monsters. The mixed sand could be packed up to be sifted elsewhere, but the ratio of sand-to-gem-dust could make it prohibitively heavy.",
        "A lifelike, gently smiling statue carved from salt, up to its knees in the sand. Those within the statue's field of view (if its eyes could see) receive a penalty to their ability to resist outside influences on their mind.",

        "The sea foam's piled ashore here over your head, and widely enough that you can't easily walk around it. Easy enough to push through it, but you can't see in it past your nose. Something's hiding in the foam, waiting for prey to wander in.",

        "Goblins training gulls to shit in peoples' eyes.",
        "A red tide laps at the shore. It's infested with vampiric, symbiotic algae. A gaggle of infested people (evident by their crimson eyes and veins) are bathing in the stuff. They try to ply you with drugs and good company to offer up some blood (any sort will do), and become increasingly agitated if you do not. Their preferred mode of attack is to spike the dose of whatever they can get you to take with a sedative and drain you while you're passed out.",
        "A sea turtle nesting site. You've arrived at just the right time to see the mass hatching. Predators will be gathering soon to pick off the baby turtles before they reach the water. Maybe you'll be joining them.",

        "A nuckalavee charges from the surf. A tireless pursuer, but can't cross freshwater.",
        "A resplendent coconut palm held sacred by local people. They know, but don't speak openly of, a ritual by which you can remove an evil presence from someone's mind (possession, madness, domination, enchantment, etc.) by trepanning them, drilling to the core of a coconut from the sacred palm, and placing the holes together to draw the evil presence from their head and into the coconut. Trees grown from coconuts used in the ritual are twisted things, bearing the mark of the evil they contained.",
        "A group clad in immaculate white robes, browbeating some reluctant few members into following them willingly into the ocean. Apparently a suicide cult. Non-members are proselytized to, and asked not to interfere.",
        "A dwindling iceberg-fortress run aground too far south by unfavourable currents. Its garrison of snow elves are paranoid towards outsiders but desperate for direction to a colder place. It's a toss-up as to which sentiment will win out.",

        "A fisher-monk stands posed upon a rock in impossible stillness, wielding a barbed harpoon. He waits for the vanishingly rare rainbow-urchin to pass by, a creature with spines of light of every hue and shade. When he spots it he'll strike with unerring precision. If interrupted before then the monk will be incomprehensibly salty.",
        "Sargasso spreads before you, from the beach to the distant horizon. Everything you've ever lost beckons from its green tangles. This is a portal to the Sargassium, a world where all things can be found again, or where you too might be lost forever.",
        "The water withdraws, the horizon swells. A tidal wave is coming.",
        "A fish-man flags you down, says they were supposed to meet with a representative from a nearby village to discuss trade agreements, tribute, and breeding rights. As that representative is late, the fish-man explains, you will have to do. Some time in to the negotiation (or fighting, or whatever else) the representative will arrive and react to you based on how you've argued for the village's interests.",

It takes a CR 25 STR check (aka someone needs to have +5 STR) to break the sandstone.",

      "Scary Forest Encounter" : [
        "When your players awake in the morning after a restless night of camping, they discover footprints all around them in the dirt. Their backpacks have been looked through, but nothing has been stolen. This happens a few more nights in a row.",
        "Someone notices eyes glittering in the dark at them. Anyone with darkvision can make out an unidentifiable shape. When light is shone towards them there is nothing there.",
        "You find a corpse with it's eyes and mouth filled with dirt, still grasping the axe that's embedded in the nearest tree.",
        "You find a massive circle of felled trees, in the center of which is a malnourished and wild-eyed greataxe wielding orc, yelling about fending off an endless hoard of regrowing enemies.",
        "A deep fog rolls in faster and thicker than one would think is natural. All rolls related to navigation or investigation based on the terrain have disadvantage.",
        "The party is set upon by a group of bandits, ferociously attacking them with abandon. Suspiciously, they do not yell or even speak. DC 10 to notice their mouths have been sewn shut and their eyes look wild with panic, as if their actions are not their own.",
        "A lone child that refuses to talk but will hold one of the adventures hands, and theirs alone (normally while sucking her thumb). If the child feels threatened, she will run away from the party and they won't be able to find her again. There are no tracks. (Optional: If they look after her for a night, she will leave them a gift.)",
        "A dog with a fancy collar appears to lead the party to an area of disturbed dirt and begins to dig it up. Upon closer inspection the party finds the body of a small girl holding a leash that looks quiet similar to the dogs collar. When they turn to examine the dog, he is nowhere to be found.",
        "Cats appear to be watching the party from the trees. Dozens upon dozens of them. Whenever a member of the party approaches them they run away and can't be found (may serve as lookouts for a darker force).",

        "Deep in the forest, approaching dusk, the party finds a logging camp. Several small cabins and a mill. Smoke curls lazily up from one or two of the chimneys. There is nobody in the camp. There are plates of food on tables, still warm. Clothes on a washing line are still damp. Only the doors into the mill are locked. As night falls, a fierce storm begins to build, and from the mill the saws can be heard rasping back and forth, though they don't sound quite right... ",
        "The party finds a scraggly, disheveled child apparently lost in the forest. It asks the party for help, should the party agree, they come under the effects of a curse until they defeat the child (Actually a restless Evil) who flees, attempting to lead them into a hazard deeper in the forest.",
        "Small dolls sit in a tree the players pass by. They are wearing crude clothes, and don sticks of specific lengths. Poor perception rolls feel anonymous sets of eyes gazing at you, while good perception rolls can discover them. These dolls, if ignored, will appear again in a different tree a few feet up, requiring lower rolls as they subtly make themselves more obvious. Upon the first investigation, you find that the dolls are poorly stitched together, with leaves still poking out of the burlap fabric, and expressionless faces with small stones as eyes. However, with each successive perception roll as the party walks away, the dolls become slightly more realistic. On additional rolls their rock-eyes appear to follow you (Mona Lisa style), their skin becomes taut and leathery, and their clothes become more realistic. Repeat as necessary, with the players unable to leave a small section of the forest (due to magical barriers, or because walking straight forward keeps leading them back to the same spots.) Eventually, all of the dolls should clearly resemble everyone in the party. It is important that the dolls never appear to move on their own, and in every way act as though an inanimate object would. They can be destroyed, ripped, held, carried, etc. There should also be at least 4 separate perception checks on the dolls IMO. It really draws the frustration out, and that is an expression of fear. The final perception check on the dolls will have the dolls be very hard to find, except by one person, who you can choose beforehand. No matter how well other party members roll, the person you choose will feel a tingling on the back of their neck, and turn around to find the dolls in a high branch. They are nearly perfect mimics of the party, and are standing around the doll that looks like the person who discovered them, whose doll has a thick piece of string around their neck. The person feels paralyzed as the can only just watch due to fear, as time slows around them. The doll-party gazes directly into the player characters real eyes, and gently...  pushes. For extra effect, have a pencil ready to snap upon this moment. Sometimes the cheesy sound effect speaks volumes more than words. The party will usually react at this point, let them destroy the dolls. It's cathartic. If you want to continue the fear though, every one in a while later on, let them see a flicker of movement out of the corner of their eyes. Bonus points if you pick a grunge or mistake to build this off of. Like if a cleric forgets to heal a fighter and the fighter calls, have one of them be the one that pushes the other off, as though the cleric purposely didn't heal, or the fighter was trying to get revenge. If the party has a rogue, have their doll slip a stick in the back of the hanged on. There's a ton of customization you can do, and if done well, you can seed a lot of discord between two player characters and build their relationship to be really dynamic. Happy Creepy Crawlies.",

        "As the party sets down for camp they hear a muttering in the shrubs and then creeping out from it they behold a Gibbering Mouther, each eye and mouth seemingly drawn from a different creature, without repetition. Just before their skin and brains begin to itch, each party member realizes they do not recognize any of their kind yet among its monstrous morphology... ",

        "A sweet glade, dappled with sunlight and shadows provide a relief from the previous heat and humidity. A gentle brook flows along one edge and gurgled merrily. Several fruit trees sit in the center and lay heavily with ripe fruits. Flowers fragrant the air and a gentle breeze cool the glen, sweetening the air and cooling the weary traveler. An old body hangs from a limb of the tree, but upon inspection it appears obvious they could have stood and not strangled.",
        "You come across an alter, freshly used and dripping with blood. Meat has been portioned and set out for something.",
        "An open clearing shows the remains of several bodies arranged in a glyph like patter. Due to dismemberment and missing pieces you are not sure how many bodies were used. As you review the scene, the trail behind you vanishes and leaves naught but deep and ancient thorn bushes, redolent with the faint reek of decaying flesh.",

        "A pile of shit with human clothes, hair and bones in.",
        "The party find a clearing with an odd nature alter in the center. While they are distracted, the trees around them move closer. If they are distracted for long enough, the trees form a complete wall. The trees do not attack; they only defend themselves if attacked.",
        "There is a tree with deep scratches in it, as if it has been attacked by a dagger. Upon inspection, the player discovers old, dried blood embedded in the bark and writing in a deep red color that says 'Find me, help me' (illusory script). As the party continues they see more trees of a similar nature, and eventually find a crazed gnome who is determined to eat party members in order to restore his youth.",
        "The path opens into a clearing. Near the center is a unicorn lying down on its side. It looks serene and peaceful. The clearing is bright and quiet. Almost silent but for distant birdsong. If the party approach they realize it is dying. Its throat is torn open by some powerful beast and the wound looks infected or poisoned. The edges of the clearing are creeping in, going brown or fungus laden and choked with weeds and branches, which seem to close in whenever no one is looking in that direction. The unicorn is probably (?) past any help the party can give but may last an hour. Left to its own devices, the clearing will close in maybe 20 minutes.",
        "The trees appear to be leaning closer together and are a different shade of green to normal trees. As a breeze blows they seem to be whispering to each other wisha... wisha... wisha",
        "The undergrowth is thick confining you to a narrow path. It switched sharply left then right... . to a dead end. Turning back it is a dead end that way. The only way forward is to hack through the lower branches and scrub. As the players do, the cut stems ooze blood. If burned instead the wet plants hiss and whistle as they burn sounding like tortured screams.",
        "You begin to notice that everything looks familiar. Slowly it dawns on you that the trees are all identical, right down to that twig that snapped off when it caught on you backpack.",
        "A family of forest giants has caught the scent of the party while hunting. They're catching up.",
        "Disembodied screams echo around you. Ghosts of the past? Or maybe it's Jim the halfling rogue, trying to scare off tourists so he can start a coalmine?",

        "You find humanoid skeletons tied together to form the rough shape of a horse. If you use speak with dead on it, it only screams.",
        "You suddenly realize that all the noise in the forest is gone. As if silence had been cast but you can still talk and make noise as normal. Suddenly the forest is filled with howls, screeches, and buzzing so loud it deafens the party. When the party can hear again the forest is back to normal.",
        "You come across a cottage in the woods belonging to a friendly woodsman and his wife. They provide food and shelter for the night. When the party awakes they are in the burned down ruins of a cottage with the skeletal remains of the farmer and his wife reaching desperately for the party.",
        "A hooded figure sits on a stump. He does not respond to anything. If you attack or touch the figure they collapse into a swarm of spiders.",

        "The party finds a wanted poster tacked to a tree with a group shot of the party with a red X marked through two of the party members faces. The party does not remember posing for this picture nor know why they would be wanted.",
        "You come upon a dry riverbed. From the trees lining the banks dangle a hundred mutilated corpses.",
        "Two children play fight with sticks, laughing and taunting each other. When they notice the party watching, they'll happily put on a show. That's when the other children emerge from the trees, only they aren't playing and they've got more than just sticks and stones.",
        "A strangely inviting cave comes in to view. Surely it's some kind of den and we shouldn't go in but I just...  cant... . help it.",
        "From deep within the forest loud clicking and chattering noises of various pitches and tempo can be heard. Upon inspection a small city raiding party dressed in armor have been brutally mutilated with heads twisted round and limbs ripped off. The same clicking noise starts again and gets closer and louder. When it seems like the creature is on top of them it suddenly stops and does not reappear.",
        "It has been at least 24 hours since sunset and it has yet to come back up. What's worse is that all the forest chatter from insects and wildlife has trickled nearly to a standstill save for one slow but consistent crunching that has been following at a distance for hours now. Are the stars even moving anymore?",
        "Early in the day the party passes underneath a suit of armor suspended in the trees, branches occupying the inside of the suit as if they had squeezed out the body that occupied it before. Branches sprout from the facemask wildly, limbs protrude from the leg and armholes, and the entire chest piece is nearly bursting from the volume of foliage it contains.",
        "Just when its time to make camp for the night yet again within the damp cold forest, the party comes across an old house sitting unoccupied in a small clearing. They seek comfort in the house, building a fire in the hearth and drinking some old booze left by previous tenants. Keeping good watch, they peer out the windows frequently. Maybe it's just the old wine but are the trees... . getting closer?",
        "A few chickens are pecking at the dirt in the middle of the trail. When you come upon them, you spook them, and they trot off into the forest a few meters. They resume pecking; but little does anyone know that they've begun to peck seeds that have the effect of the enlarge spell. Treat an enlarged chicken as an allosaurus and let the fun begin.",
        "Glowing eyes stare out of a knothole in an old and gnarled tree. When the players notice it watching, the thing scampers deeper into the tree. If they investigate the knothole they'll find it goes deep, deeper than the tree itself. At the bottom of the hole something glitters. Gold? Many more glowing eyes stare up around it.",
        "A corpse sways in the branches of a lonely willow by a stream, dangling from a noose. The corpse is grinning, and dancing a slow, merry jig.",
        "Something howls in the distance. Another something responds. Not wolves. The howls are too ragged, sound too much like words.",
        "A little twig-and-twine doll is pinned to a branch up ahead. Another just like it can be seen just off the path, and another beyond that one. Even in the depths of the woods you'll be protected so long as you follow them. Your safety once you arrive where they're leading you is less guaranteed. A polite invitation has been extended. It won't come again.",
        "Moaning can be heard from a bush. Within is a hunter, near-death, near incoherent from fear. No mere animal could have inflicted the wounds he bears. They're too precise, suggestive of strange symbols.",
        "The trees in this part of the forest are all wrong. They're growing in neat rows; they sway though there is no wind. Strange fruits swell in their boughs. You've stumbled into an orchard. Were those stones you stepped over a ways back someone's fence?",
        "A boar bursts out of the undergrowth; foaming spittle flecks its tusks. It charges, eyes bloodshot, but makes no move to defend itself. All its attacks seem half-hearted. What drove this beast to seek death so?",
        "Cloying mist drifts into the region. You can barely see five paces ahead of you. Vague, bulbous forms can be seen protruding from the trees as you pass. Fungus. This isn't mist, it's spores.",
        "A fire shines through the trunks a little ways from you. Around it are adventurers, like you, camping for the night. None of them speak the same languages as you. The forest has them spooked, paranoid. They'll welcome familiar company at first, but any number of things you do could set them off.",
        "A pond in a clearing, clean and still. No animal drinks from it, no insects buzz above it. No monsters will approach here beyond the tree line. Is it safe for you to stay here?",
        "The forest path is narrow and overgrown. Looking down the tunnel-like trail gives you vertigo and puts you off balance. Shadows appear to move and you feel like you're just going in circles.",
        "The forest itself seems to be against your presence. Roots seem to spring up to trip you and branches swat at you when moved out of the way. The canopy closes around you shutting out the sunlight.",
        "The players hear footsteps echoing theirs, slightly behind, but the path is empty. Anything they call out is repeated back with missing syllables, as if the voice is in pain.",
        "A child's laughter is heard off of the path, along with a flicker of light, which keeps appearing further away if the party follows. It leads them to the body of an elven boy with an arrow in his back.",
        "One member of the party hears the creaking of the trees and sounds of the forest suddenly stop, then a voice right behind them whispers their name on a hoarse voice, but there is no one there. None of the others notice anything different.",
        "The players hear the sounds of cries and screams from soldiers and the guttural cries of a nightmarish creature echo through the forest. The last one goes quiet before they reach them. If they choose to search, they find scattered around the ground the weather-worn skeletal remains of 16 soldiers from a long-dead empire known for it's brutal methods, some of which are found ripped apart apparently trying to flee.",
        "The players feel as though something is watching them, but can't see anything in the darkness. If they move more than 30ft in any direction they hear rustling following, but no matter how much they search cannot find anything.",
        "A dead character from one of the character's past stands amongst the trees, with the appearance and wounds they had when they died. Only one person can see them. The character doesn't move, but silently watches the player. Any attacks go through them without causing damage. They dissolve into a smoke-like darkness after 1d6 minutes.",
        "The sound of whispering is heard behind a bush. When it is pulled back or someone moves behind it, the whispering stops abruptly and a darkened feather falls slowly to the ground.",
        "A group of little girls are tied to the trees just off of the path, crying quietly. If the party goes to rescue them, they fight being rescued and attempt to escape and retie themselves to the trees, warning that 'the Grogleman' will come for them and their families too if they return home.",
        "A group of giants sit motionless around a giant chessboard, eyes intent on the pieces. Closer examination reveals the three are corpses; fungi grow from their eyelids and out of their hair, and the bodies slump and collapse if touched.",
        "The ground on both sides of the trail seems odd; upon closer examination, it is absolutely swarming with termites, covering the whole ground like a wave. If the party steps off the trail, the insects scatter from the party's feet, leaving strange, momentary footprints in the ground.",
        "Prayers cannot be uttered aloud in the forest; spells can be cast as normal, but any verbal component comes out as a rattling hiss.",
        "A thick fog hovers over the ground, reaching up about two feet (to the chests of any halflings in the party, to the knees of humans). Anyone putting their heads in the fog (bending down to pick something up, etc.) hears muffled screams and far-off voices begging for their lives.",
        "Each person awakes to find a large meat hook carefully placed along on their bedrolls over their stomachs.",
        "In the periphery of the party's vision, the trees that they pass seem to take on the image of a grim army, marching next to the party. When faced directly, the trees seem rather normal. The whole forest smells like a battlefield.",
        "Every time anyone lights a fire in the forest, there is a sudden hissing and smoking from the ground for twenty feet around the sparks. Little red lines appear like veins in the earth before fading to blackness.",
        "A monkey in a Jester's costume comes swinging through the trees, hooting and screeching. If the adventurers catch the monkey, they find a bloody knife stuck in its belt. The monkey stares at them all with a baleful expression.",
        "Crows are screaming at each other as the party enters the woods. Increasingly, the screams sound like words, demanding blood.",
        "The hedge on the side of the trail has strange burn marks in it, almost exactly in the shape of men.",
        "A fox with a bloodied and broken leg comes limping up the path to the party and will pass by it if it can. If anyone speaks to it, the fox changes form into an old druidic woman, who mumbles about the forest being unsalvageable.",
        "As the party walks into the forest, they are greeted by an adventuring group coming the opposite direction. They chat for a little bit, explaining they found the woods too dangerous and are making their way back to whatever town the party has just come from. A little farther into the woods, the party finds the corpses of the same adventuring group, gathered around the sputtering embers of a fire... ",
        "A bucket has been nailed to a tree, with a crude sign saying 'Donations' hanging under it. The bucket is half-filled with fingers and toes in varying levels of freshness.",
        "A small, neat signboard reads, 'Please remain on the path.' The neatness is somewhat marred by the corpses strewn below the sign.",
        "Someone has sharpened the branches around the trail in the forest, so that the trail is surrounded by sharp points.",
        "The party finds themselves staring at a strange tableaux- the corpse of a squirrel is placed next to an acorn, followed by (in order) the corpse of a cat, a dog, a wolf, and a bear. Behind the bear are strange scuffmarks in the dirt, like there was another corpse behind it, this one in the shape of something human... ",
        "As the party walks through the forest, a strange figure suddenly drops from the trees in front of them- upon inspection, it is an effigy in the rough shape of a man, made of wooden boughs and leaves. This happens twice more as they walk. The fourth time, the figure drops down again, but anyone going to clear it away finds that it is actually the corpse of a man this time, with branches lashed to his limbs and a grisly smile on his face... ",
        "A cold mist creeps into the surrounding area, players who breathe it will be asked to make a roll (perception, nature, etc.) but they're making a constitution save with whatever modifier from the false roll. Anyone who rolls above a set DC inhales the mist and is subject to strange illusions.",
        "A hanged man rests on a lone tree. His pockets lined with petty change and a note that appears to be an apology letter to his family.",
        "For an hour of travel there's no sound other than the party.",
        "A section of the forest has been frosted over in what appears to be a permanent winter. The center appears to have an unnatural cave of rocks that don't match anything of the surrounding geological features. Inside features a drop that appears to be without end.",
        "A small portal opens up about 15 ft. above the party, expelling a blood lusted demon to the ground below. It bounces, stunned momentarily before it acquires a new target.",
        "A large head-sized knot in a tree resembles a human face. Wait! The eyes are real: wide, staring, terrified eyes! They look at you as you approach, flicking to each person that talks. But they cannot blink (so cannot communicate in that way), but constantly weep a watery sap.",
        "A large open area. The dirt seems fresher than the rest, no grass growing on the surface. The trees around the edge of the grove are burnt. In the middle sits (1d4) huge skulls, each at least 5 times the height of an average human. These skulls have gashes and claw marks in them, as well as huge spiraling or pointed horns. Scratched into the largest one is 'entrance' in infernal. If the player puts their ear to the ground and listens, they can faintly hear a low rumble that unnerves them to their very core and they don't know why. Digging downwards could potentially reveal a connection between the material plain and one of the evil-aligned outer plains.",
        "The first character to awaken sees a grotesquely exaggerated face hovering inches from their own, glowing weakly with an internal light. An ear-to-ear grin splits the face, revealing a maw with three rows of serrated teeth. When the character blinks, the face disappears. It never appears again.",
        "The party comes across perfectly circle clearing. It's barren waste, nothing ever grows there. Any flora the party might bring with them instantly wilts as it crosses the border. No animal, even as faithful as ranger's companions, can be forced to cross into that circle. If the party decides to spend a night there, they will wake up outside the circle, with all their things scattered across the outer rim of the clearing. If they do it on the night of winter solstice, they will wake up in Avernus instead.",
        "The trees suddenly grow until the sun is blocked out and a magical darkness is cast from somewhere, and whenever the players talk, they hear their words repeated to them in their voice, but can't tell where it's coming from.",
        "The players slowly realize that they are on a loop in the forest. Every night they make camp, then wake up with supplies returned and make the exact same journey again. The players must find the source of this curse and free themselves.",
        "While the party makes camp, someone notices that there is an additional person around the fire. How did no one notice? Why does it smell like rotten meat? And why is it looking at the barbarian like that?",
        "In a less dense part of the forest, where moonlight pours through, the party witnesses a strange hulking creature (Mothman) perched on a tall tree. Its giant red eyes watch the party for a moment, before the creature flies away. The party sees the creature a few more times before coming to a large bridge built over a dangerous river. The creature appears one more time over head, just as the bridge collapses.",
        "After camping in the woods the party awakens to find the trees around them whipping and lashing as if buffeted by strong winds, though the party feels not even a faint breeze. Upon closer inspection, the party notices in mounting horror that the shadows cast by the trees are in the shape of human beings writhing in silent agony.",
        "The party comes across a 50ft circle of pitch-black darkness, with no logical reason as to its existence. Any players that cannot see when in such conditions hear whispers and chattering while in this area, and take 1d6 slashing damage for every round spent there. Any players that can see in such conditions (ex. darkvision) will not suffer any of these effects, and will see that nothing is attacking the others, but rather the wounds are manifesting onto them.",
        "You see corpses pinned to the sharpened boughs and branches of the tress around you, wood puncturing through their throats and sternums. The mottled moonlight filtering through the slowly swaying leaves gives them an eerie sense of motion. A sudden scampering and swish of branches punches through the soft rustling of the trees. Wherever you turn, the sound seems to be coming from behind you, getting closer and closer till you feel a hot, wet breath on the back of your neck. You swing around to confront the horror and see nothing but the corpses in the canopy, leering down at you like demonic pi?atas.",
        "The party stumbles upon a clearing, with a post stamped into the ground. A message scrawled in Primordial reads about a treasure found in the hidden home of squirrels. With a few investigation checks, the party finds an odd tree. Around the back of the tree is a poorly hidden, though hidden, door. The door has no lock on it, but is not open; it has a feeling as though it is stuck. It can be forced open, or pried open, or cut open with fairly decent resistance. Inside is a staircase leading downward, lit by candles embedded in the tree that don't seem like they're burning the tree, though they are quite bright. After a 5-minute descent, the staircase ends in what appears to be a basement. The ceilings drip, and the room is damp and warm. (You can also narrate that the stairs are slippery, and have your players roll athletics not to slip). A decent perception roll can see that the floor and ceiling leak the warm water, without much of a source, while a really good perception check will notice that the color of the environment has become darker, and has a reddish tinge. Otherwise, there appears to be a library or study (whichever is easier for you to narrate.) There are no loose papers or pens and all of the books appear to be locked up, so that they cannot be taken out. A chest in the back can be found, a hair too conspicuously. Upon opening it, there is nothing inside but a pit, that smells of vomit and acid. With that, the room begins to shrink, slowly. The party should discover that they're in the mouth of a giant mimic, who is swallowing them. Upon escaping, the entire tree uproots itself, spits and snarls at the players, and runs away. Best described if you can drop hints about descending the gullet of a beast, such as a hot draft, or distant gurgling.",
        "The party makes camp, and partway through the night, someone on watch starts to get an off feeling. Depending on perception rolls, they may or may not see the eyes watching from up in the trees, though they disappear just after being noticed. Additionally, they may hear the sound of leathery wings gliding through the air above them. Finally, after their defenses being lightly probed/tested, a creature attacks. (IIRC)I used a giant flying chupacabra from PF, but whatever works for you. The creature goes down relatively easily, but as it is struck down, it lets out a piercing scream. As quiet settles, the party hears answering cries from deeper in the woods."

It outlines human sacrifice, a staple ritual used in blood magic, but this mage theorizes that pentagramic foundations of rituals DO NOT yield the best results. Instead, Hexagramic foundations will boost the magical return of such grisly rituals by an exponential amount.

The accounts of previous openers of the book may be read, but at the cost of the reader's most private life being exposed by the book for all eternity, with a level of detail that only increases the longer the book is left open.

However, this also works the other way around. Introduction: The protagonist could be either extreme good or extreme evil character killing like-oriented individuals. The PCs then find out about the heart.",

Spending a 8h inside of it can bring a man back from the brink of death, regenerate limbs and halt aging. Spending time inside of it without any injuries starts to drain a person's humanity and they move closer to chaotic evil alignment.",

In order to attune to this artifact you must hold it pressed to your heart during a short rest. The artifact slowly enters your chest and fuses with your heart. Unattuning kills the person because the artifact can't be unfused from their heart. While attuned to this artifact you have advantage on death saving throws. Also you can open up a portal that leads to the plane of Mechanus or back to the material plane from Mechanus once per day. Modrons recognize Primus' creation and will avoid fights with the person attuned the clockwork heart unless they are attacked. Once a creature has attuned to the Clockwork Heart, they begin to gradually lose the ability to feel emotion and instead become more logical. The process is slow, but speeds up significantly whenever an aspect of the heart is used (such as opening a portal to Mechanus or making a death saving throw only because of the advantage provided by the artifact). At the end of the process, the creature will be completely unable to experience any emotion and will become a logic-centered being.",

The mirror itself can also cast various mind control spells on targets visible in the mirror at the user's behest (DM's discretion on which and the number of uses per day). The insidiousness is multiplied because the mirror's control is such that targets may not realize that they were influenced by a spell, especially if they were only instructed to do reasonable things. The mirror can even be used to disadvantage the charisma and wisdom saving throws of targets visible in it if needed. Other Suggestions: The Machiavellian Mirror's owner should be intelligent and paranoid, someone who takes all sorts of mundane and magical precautions to prevent the mirror from being visible and even having a reflection, especially when not in use. The owner should also take precautions to make sure they are knowledgeable of even potential threats, and that they are visible and findable at all times (e.g. command a ring of spies).",

When the attuned individual is at the table, he can set a blood-filled miniature on it to gain an immediate bird's eye view of the donor's surroundings, up to 50 miles square.

Because of the unique construction of the ornate shield you can redirect blows onto other people within 5 feet of you as a reaction. Naturally you can only do this once per turn. The catch, other than nobody wanting to stand next to you anymore, is a compulsion to avoid being hit at the expense of others.

You cast at the spell's base level and bonuses that improve your healing capabilities (such as feats, domains, or class benefits) do not apply as these powers come from a dark place. These spells cannot be cast stealthily; conversely, casting them attracts attention. Your teammates prefer your healing touch even if a more skilled cleric is present.

      "Bag of Luck - A seemingly ordinary leather bag with no markings or sinister aura whatsoever. It is secured by a thong long enough to go over a person's head, and will not open until someone places the thong around their neck. Inside the Bag of Luck are 24 pearlescent beads that smell delicious and seem almost to glow with their own light. Each bead is exactly one hour of luck, 12 good, 12 bad. There is no way to determine which is which without eating it and activating it. When under the effect of a good luck bead the user cannot fail in anything involving an element of luck. In game terms, every single die roll the user makes will be a critical success. When under the effects of a bad luck bead the user cannot succeed in anything involving an element of luck. In game terms every single die roll will be a critical failure. Any attempt to use logic or trickery to determine which beads are which by, for example taking one bead and seeing that it was bad luck and then eating all the remaining 23 on the theory that the good luck will counterbalance the bad luck, will backfire. In that example what the user took for bad luck initially will all turn out to have long term positive effects and taking all the remaining beads will result in catastrophe and possibly death from ill fortune. The bag cannot be taken from the user's neck until all beads are eaten. Any attempt to remove the bag before then will result in the bag tightening around the user's neck and strangling them until they stop trying to remove it. If the beads are not all used within 72 hours the bag will strangle and kill the user. Do you feel lucky?",
      "The Essay of Eris - A seemingly ordinary sheet of paper or parchment. Anyone reading it will see believable, plausible, and totally false, evidence that those closest to them are conspiring against them to kill or enslave them or worse. The contents may appear to be a personal letter from one person to another, a report from a rival agency, or whatever else would be most likely to cause the reader to think their friends or allies had betrayed them. There is no magic coercion; the reaction of the reader is entirely a matter of how paranoid they are. A normal person with no reason to think they have enemies it might dismiss its claims entirely. But if put into a delicate situation where betrayal is likely it can cause civil wars, bring down spy agencies, and turn a room of distrustful conspirators into a howling mob with each person seeking to kill all the others.",

When driven into the eyes of a victim with a hammer, killing the victim they will ignite and over the course of ten minutes all flesh will burn from the victim's skull. It is now a Burning Skull of Sithrax and is continuously aflame about as hot as a normal fireplace fire. The Burning Skull of Sithrax will answer four questions 100% accurately, 100% honestly, and as unhelpfully as possible. When not answering questions the Burning Skull of Sithrax screams curses, threats, and describes in horrifying detail the tortures that Sithrax will inflict on all in earshot. After the fourth question is asked and answered the Burning Skull of Sithrax will consume itself and turn to ash after ten minutes of screaming the deepest and darkest secrets of the last person to ask it a question to anyone who can hear. Afterward the Eyespikes of Sithrax revert to their inert state and can be driven into the eyes of another victim.",
      "Siphon of Asmodeus - A gleaming silver chain about three feet long with a golden disk on one end and a copper disk on the other. It allows the person holding the golden disk to transfer injury, age, illness, tiredness, or any other negative condition to the person touching the copper disk. Any injury, regardless of severity or age, can be transferred. A person missing an arm could transfer that to the person on the copper end causing the victim to lose their arm while the person holding the gold disk regained their arm. Given a supply of victims a person with the Siphon of Asmodeus could theoretically live forever, in perpetual youth and perfect health. The most insidious aspect of the Siphon is that there are no downsides at all to the person benefiting. Their health is not creepy; their youth is not waxy. Using the Siphon is not painful to either the victim or the user, though obviously the victim may feel pain from whatever injuries or age are transferred to them. This, of course, encourages the owner to use it and by doing so spread misery and damn themselves.",
      "Demonbone Bow - The Demonbone Bow was crafted by the Church of Heavenly Light, a sect of fanatic demon hunting crusaders who believed that the ends justify the means and that demons deserved whatever fate they got. Made from bones and sinew extracted from a dozen living demons flayed and suspended from blessed chains while the Church did its grisly work. The bow is a weapon made specifically to kill demons, and it does the job quite well. Even when normal arrows are shot from the bow it does quadruple damage to demons, and when using arrows made from demon bone it will slay any common demon with a single hit, and do ten times normal damage even to demon lords. Those who use the bow become sadistic, careless ending of life in the name of their cause, and soon seek only the most brutal and agonizing means of achieving their goals. Whether this is due to the corrupting influence of the material from which the bow is made, or from the zealotry that went into its construction is an open question.",
      "The Tongue of Beelzebub - Appearing as a desiccated human tongue, if a sufficiently devoted (or deranged) person cuts out their own tongue and replaces it with the Tongue of Beelzebub the tongue will become living and work like a normal tongue. Once installed the Tongue of Beelzebub allows the user to lie perfectly. The user gains a large bonus to any skill related to lying, conning, deceit or any other illicit act involving speech. Lying becomes so natural, so second nature, to the user that within a week they must make an effort of will to tell the truth in any situation (in game terms, they need to pass a Will check that becomes increasingly difficult with each month of use). The user also gains an insatiable thirst for human blood, needing to drink the final drops of blood from the heart of a debauched liar, drunkard, or other sinful person every two weeks or they will begin to suffer effects identical to dying of thirst and will, in fact, die after two weeks and three days without blood. There is no way to get the necessary blood without killing a 'sinful' person. After one year of use, the person cannot speak the truth under any circumstances at all and loses the ability to discern reality from fantasy or truth from lies. They say whatever they think will benefit them the most in that moment with no regard at all for its truth or falsehood and those who hear them speak tend to believe them even if they contradict themselves. After two years of use the person tells lies to themselves, believing themselves to be the greatest, the best, the most amazing, and their ego grows to make them incapable of believing that anyone can do anything at all better than them. Most users die shortly after this, having convinced themselves that they can fly, or that they can defeat a giant in single combat, or other deadly tasks. The Tongue is currently held by a group of Beelzebub cultists who worship its user as the voice of Beelzebub on Earth and believe that the truth of the cosmos and other great things can be discerned from the lies if only one is clever enough to do so. Despite the fact that most who use the Tongue die after only two years there is always great competition among the devotees of Beelzebub to become its next bearer.",

The crown has a soft inner luminescence reminiscent of the night sky, making the wearer emit dim light in a 10-foot radius while they wear it. Attuning to the crown grants the wearer the ability to use the crown's properties, as well as immunity to cold damage as well as blindsight out to 60 feet. Both properties can only be used if the wearer is directly under the open night sky. Once per day, the wearer may use an action to use the crown's Herald of Winter property to change the weather in a 3-mile around the point they activate this property to some sort of snowy weather of the wearer's choosing. This weather can range anywhere from a gentle snowfall to a moderately strong blizzard, and requires 1d4 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. The weather lasts for 8 hours, and requires no concentration to maintain. In addition, three times per day, the wearer may use an action to use the crown's Freezing Light property.

Once per day, the wielder may use an action to use the blade's Shroud of Autumn property if they are attuned to the scimitar. The wielder calls forth a swirling cyclone of leaves around themselves in a 5-foot radius for up to a minute. While the cyclone is active, all ranged attacks made against the wielder have disadvantage. If the property is used while within an area with moderate density foliage, the cyclone instead has a 10-foot radius and causes all melee attacks to be made with disadvantage as well. The wielder also gains the ability to use their reaction to cause a ranged attack passing through the cyclone to automatically miss its target. The wielder may stop the cyclone and have the leaves drift away using a bonus action on their turn. If the property is used while within an area with high-density foliage, the cyclone gains new benefits in addition to the previous improvements. The cyclone instead has a 15-foot radius, which is considered difficult terrain while the cyclone is active, and all ranged attacks not made by the wielder automatically miss if they enter the cyclone. One time while the cyclone is active, the wielder can form blade replicas from the swirling leaves to attack a multitude of foes. By doing so, the wielder uses an action to make a single melee weapon attack with the scimitar against any number of creatures inside the cyclone, with a separate attack roll for each target.",

The only curiosity is a sad old man with a gnarled crown sitting upon a small bench, not quite in the foreground though impossible to ignore.

      "A deathly pale, young humanoid that appears to be around twenty to thirty years of age. They are reclined comfortably in a deep, cushioned casket, reading a book. By the light of a magical smokeless candle they are very proud of, they beckon you down a hatch in the bottom of their casket to a small hidden cave. The cave, though dimly lit, is actually very homey. The walls are lined with over full, wooden bookcases, stacks of books line a narrow path to a comfortable chair. The youth explains that hundreds of years ago, they grew tired of being accused of vampirism just because they are immortal (they are very dismissive of the fact that they are immortal and don?t seem to know the source of their immortality themselves). They decided to gather as many books as they could, use the money they had put aside to construct this secret room and buy a comfortable coffin, then fake their death. Hundreds of years later they definitely don?t regret their decision, only pausing briefly before offering the party a quest for more books to fully restock the youth?s ?library?, along with whatever reward is offered, the party gets all of the old books to do with as they please, as well as a small volume of surprisingly well written fanfiction.",

During your efforts to excavate the coffin, you find splintered wood, investigation of the wood reveals it to be from a coffin. Digging further down towards the rest of the coffin, you find a huge, hunched, mishapen skeleton. It appears, though twisted, to be posed as if it had been the one lain to rest in the coffin. Other uncovered parts of the coffin appear to be normal humanoid sized; coinpurse, tatters of clothing, even what remains of a pair of shoes near the huge skeleton?s feet are medium sized. Some jewelry lies broken among the bones, a necklace emanating fading transmutation magic near the skeleton?s neck with its chain snapped and two rings split from the inside laying upon the finger bones. The headstone reads to the effect of: ? Here lies our dear Gerald. He helped heal the hole in our family. We forgive you Gerald, for whatever you kept apologizing for.?",

You can see the limbs twitching and trying to move, but as more flesh and muscle rots away, the efforts are weaker and weaker. After almost a full minute of this, the youth can no longer move any of its body except for its eyes and what remains of its face. Its eyes dart around, you can tell that it is intelligent but clearly terrified and in maddening agony. Any healing magic seems to cause it even more pain, and it is impossible to put it out of its misery. Eventually it rots to nothingness.",

      "An ancient, leather-bound volume written in an archaic script describes the composition and arrangement of the Outer Planes. Strangely, a rather substantial section of text - consisting of an entire chapter if you are translating the numbering correctly - has been torn out of the book. Despite this fact, you can detect no obvious gaps in the volume's coverage of its subject matter. What unknown plane did that chapter describe?",

Although its wood is brightly polished and the red of its satin curtains is bright and fresh, the hand-painted sign upon its front (reading \"The Wondrous Shows of Punch and Judy\" in carnival lettering) is chipped and faded. If the curtains are opened (using a set of finely woven pulley ropes which lie inside the theater), the puppets - stored in a concealed compartment \"backstage\" - will come to life and perform elaborate shows of their own volition.",

      "An astrologer's chart, inscribed with the finest instruments and the greatest precision upon a vellum which is both supple and expensive.

      "A large signet ring of gold, worked with a unicorn crest. Any commoner who dons the ring will suddenly discover its metal heated to unbearable levels - causing one hit point of damage per round. However, anyone with noble blood (however slight), or destined to become a noble at some point in the future, who does the same will suffer only a momentary flash of pain (with an accompanying 1 hp of damage): They will find that the unicorn crest has reshaped itself to their own heraldry, which has also been branded in miniature form upon the back of their finger. From this point forward, they can put on or remove the ring at will without any further ill effects.",

      "Mechanical mice which run through the walls of an ancient keep. They have done so for longer than written record can attest. They seem to be a benign presence - lacking even the slightest pestilent qualities of their flesh-and-blood counterparts - and have become an accepted presence here. Who their creator was, how they are fueled, and what purpose they serve (if any) are mysteries which may never be solved.",
      "A clairseach harp in the style of the northern barbarians, but crafted with an elegance which suggests the decadence of a great civilization. Its strings are almost too fine to be perceived with the naked eye, and when they are played they resonate with the force of a full orchestra.",

      "Carved into a natural rock face is an elaborately decorated arch. When first seen it appears to be merely decorative, with the supposed \"doorway\" leading into solid, unfinished rock. If the arch is approached by sentients, however, it will suddenly burst into life with a scintillating array of light. Anyone entering this magical portal will disappear for several seconds before being returned to the very spot from which they left.",
      "A small, leather-bound book filled with prophecies. All of them will be found to be true, but the last of them is dated just a few weeks ago.",
      "The mounted head of a deer, its impossibly massive horns possessed of a thousand and one points.",

      "Within a wooden box carved with pastoral scenes lies a leather purse, and within the purse are a handful of seeds. If these seeds are planted, they will take root and grow into plants of unnatural shape, hue, and life unlike anything seen upon this world, and operating by utterly alien principles.",
      "A scabbard stained the dark color of rust. Any blade which is placed within the scabbard will emerge covered in a sheen of blood.",
      "Within a house the PCs find an incredibly detailed doll's house - a seemingly perfect representation of the very house in which they stand. In fact, upon closer inspection they will find the very room in which they stand, inhabited by a number of dolls equal to their own number, who are, in turn, examining a miniature doll house. This miniature doll house, in turn, is a perfect duplicate in its own right - complete with smaller dolls examining an even smaller house. If the investigation continues beyond a certain point (most likely requiring the use of some variety of magic), it will be shown that the iterative pattern begins to break down - things begin to be subtly altered with each subsequent doll house the PCs reveal. Eventually, these changes will begin to assume a horrifying aspect - made all the more horrible as it is discovered that these iterations are being wrought upon the world of the PCs.",
      "A cursed fishing pole made of blackened ash. It will never catch a fish - although, if one attempts to use it unbaited, they will succeed in catching skeleton fish.",
      "A bouquet of cut roses which will successively bloom and wilt over the course of a few moments.",
      "A disc of gold upon a chain of similar material. It appears, in almost all respects, to be a talisman of pure good (DMG, pg. 239) - but, in fact, it is a fake. At the DM's discretion its creators may have enchanted it as a periapt of health or amulet of health in order to perpetrate their hoax more effectively.",

      "A tiny diorama made of oak and silver, depicting a prophecy of the last days of the world in vivid detail.",
      "A diamond of incredible beauty which slowly shifts its color from the purest white to canary to blue to black and back again.",
      "An ancient mummy which was given full burial rites and laid within a stately sarcophagus. Arranged on five pedestals around the sarcophagus are the canopic jars in which the mummy's vital organs were placed. Although the mummy is not of the undead, opening these jars will reveal that its organs continue to function: The heart beats, the lungs fill with air and empty again, and so forth.",
      "A quiver of golden arrows. They are devoid of supernatural properties, but despite their unusual composition will perform as normal arrows would.",
      "A leaf from the great tree Yggdrasil.",
      "A set of wooden wind chimes which plays a different tune depending upon the direction of the wind which disturbs it.",
      "A charm of twisted black obsidian. Touching the charm unleashes strange, ghostly visions from a strange and alien world - utterly different in every particular, but eerily similar to our own world in its broad scope and form.",
      "The neverburning torch. A jet black torch, with an inscription in gold upon its side: \"Only in your hour of darkest need will I light.\" All attempts - magical or otherwise - to light the torch will fail, but if the character carrying the torch ever finds himself upon the brink of death, the neverburning torch will flare to life.",
      "In the face of a mountain, an ancient stone stairway has been cut.
